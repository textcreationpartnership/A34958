            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>John Crellius Miniſter of the <hi>Racovian</hi> Church, To the Chriſtian Reader, GREETING.</head>
            <p>WE ſet forth not long ſince, Chriſtian Reader, a Book touching God and his Attributes, which we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed before the Books of <hi>John Volkelius</hi> touching the true Religion: When we diſcourſed therein touching the Unity of God, it ſeemed requiſite to the full explication of that Unity, that we ſhould ſhew the moſt high God to be One, not in Eſſence onely, but alſo in Perſon, and to be no other then the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and indeed we began to demonſtrate this with divers Arguments, and to guard thoſe Arguments againſt ſuch Exceptions as were either common, or ſomewhat more ſpecious and plauſible. But ſince the Work did, as we there ſaid, grow under our hand, we thought that this Treatiſe was to be parted from the reſt of the Work: For not onely the plenty of Arguments, which did of their own accord offer themſelves to us out of the Scripture, increaſed the bulk of our Writing; but alſo our deſire not willingly to omit any of thoſe things which might ſeem to men
<pb facs="tcp:64944:3"/> to be of ſome moment for the over-throwing of out Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>For ſince, for this Opinion chiefly, touching One God the Father, though grounded upon many moſt clear Teſtimonies of the Scripture, we are expoſed to the moſt bitter hatred and Perſecution of all men, I thought it very expedient to ſhew what great injury was done unto us in this behalf; yea, how injurious the Chriſtian World was to it ſelf, in ſo obſtinately rejecting this part of the Divine Truth; eſpecially ſince there is ſo various and notable uſe of this Doctrine in Divinity, and in the whole Chriſtian Religion, as by the help of God we will ſhew in the end of theſe Books. Now I thought this Book to be the more neceſſary, in that I ſaw our Men, whilſt they were dayly oppoſed by the Adverſaries, for the moſt part with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile Mind and Pen, were chiefly buſied in anſwering their Reaſons, inſerting their own Arguments commonly in brief, and in a ſcattered manner here and there; inaſmuch as they acted the parts of Reſpondents rather than Opponents. For though certain Eminent Men in our Church did ſometimes begin to take upon them the Office of Opponents in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie; yet being diverted by other labour of Writing, they were ſorced to lay this out of their hands: Wherefore they left to us nothing but the beginning of that Work which they undertook to this end, and which we certain years ago did publiſh. Certainly it was a thing exceedingly to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ſuch men, far better furniſhed with Wit, and with Knowledge of Divine Things, than we are, had rather finiſhed this Work, than left it to Us to be perfected: But inaſmuch as that hath not been done by them, we ought not to ſuffer that it ſhould never be accompliſhed. Now we might the more boldly attempt this labour, in that the evident Truth of the Opinion, and the multitude of moſt ſolid Arguments ariſing of their own accord out of the holy Scriptures, did eaſe the meanneſs of our Wit; and in that we ſaw how the Opinion it ſelf had for ſo many years together been oppoſed by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſo acute Adverſaries, with all ſorts of Arms and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, to no purpoſe: wherefore we took Courage from the Goodneſs of the Cauſe. Truly we hope in God and Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:64944:3"/> that they who are ſtudious of knowing the Truth, when they ſhall have weighed our Arguments, will ſee the Truth of that Opinion that we hold; yea, that they alſo whoſe minds are ſo beſet and beſieged with pre-conceived Opinions, that they will at no hand give place to the Truth, will notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perceive (if they will have but the patience to reade our Writing) that we were not moved with ſlight Reaſons from that Opinion which hath for ſo many Ages been received in the Chriſtian World; and if they have any Equity and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity left in them, will ceaſe to purſue us with ſo great an hatred for ſo doing: For though we, relying on the Divine Help, are ready to ſuffer any thing for the Truths ſake; yet would it be the part of others, not only to abſtain from all bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of Hatred, but alſo to be touched with compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them whom they thought to be fallen indeed into a great Error, but yet were driven thereinto with no ſlight grounds: For it is not the part of a Chriſtian, yea, not of a Man, when he thinketh any one fallen into ſome Error of Judgment, though in a weighty matter, not onely to forbear in a courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way to raiſe him up out of the ſame, but alſo with a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpirit to plunge him further thereinto. But let them do what they pleaſe, we in the mean time truſt in God that they ſhall never be able to make us repent of the Opinion which we profeſs. Howbeit, Chriſtian Reader, we beſeech thee by the love both of the Truth, and of thy own Salvation, that thou wouldeſt diligently conſider the things which we write, and examine them by the Rule of Gods Word: We crave nothing which the Apoſtle hath not already required of thee, whilſt he commandeth to <hi>try all things, and hold faſt that which is good.</hi> To deſpiſe and ſlight thoſe things, is altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Piety: For though we ſhould omit other things, which are to be mentioned in their place; conſider that the Glory of God is herein concerned, the leaſt part whereof, is greater than the greateſt of humane Affairs; whereon notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſee how much pains all, and thou perhaps thy ſelf doeſt beſtow. The ignorance of theſe things is excuſable in another, becauſe he hath perhaps wanted an opportunity to be acquainted with them, and ſo is not guilty of contempt;
<pb facs="tcp:64944:4"/> but thou canſt have no excuſe for thy ſelf before that Judge, who, that thou mayſt no longer be ignorant, offers thee an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of better information; thereby cauſing that thou canſt not be ignorant of thoſe things without contempt: The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth ſuffers not it Self to be deſpiſed Scot-free. Thou knoweſt that of our Saviour,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.48.</note> 
               <hi>To whom much is given, of him much ſhall be required; and with whom they have depoſited much, the more ſhall be expected of him.</hi> The Lord will require more of thee than of others, becauſe he affordeth thee a more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple occaſion of knowing the Truth, than to many others: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware leſt that moſt Righteous Judge finde thee an Unrighteous Judge in this Cauſe; who, when thou heareſt our Adverſaries every where oppoſing us, for the moſt part with Rayling, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Reaſon, doſt notwithſtanding refuſe to hear us, who defend our Selves and our Opinion in a modeſt manner. But if thou farther dareſt to condemn our Cauſe, holding that we are not onely excluded out of Heaven, but ought alſo to be baniſhed out of all Countreys; think with thy ſelf, that to condemn Men before their Cauſe is heard, is to condemn them as innocent. Neither will it be enough for thee to refer the labour of examining unto others, ſo as to follow their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without thine own; Think that thou thy ſelf muſt anſwer for thy ſelf: Thou, thou, I ſay, according to thy Underſtanding and Opportunity, oughteſt to <hi>try all things, and hold faſt that which is good:</hi> For, ſhalt thou commit all things unto others? take heed, and that very diligently, leſt thou commit thy ſelf and thy Salvation unto men either negligent, or puffed up with an Opinion of Learning and Knowledge, or wholly addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to humane Authority and pre-conceived Opinion, or otherwiſe obſtinate, and not knowing how to yeild; or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their own quiet and ſecurity, rather than their own or others Salvation; or cowardly, and not daring to utter their Opinion: In ſhort, leſt blindly following blind Guides, thou fall with them into the Ditch. Think not they are Godly, and Lovers of the Truth, whom I follow: For to omit that this Opinion concerning others is often-times confuted by their manners and Actions, there are many hiding holes of Vices, and private Cloſets in the Breſts of Men, into which none
<pb facs="tcp:64944:4"/> but God and Chriſt can penetrate; ſo that we are in greater danger of miſtaking in our Judgment concerning other mens Piety, when we go this way to work, than if the queſtion only is concerning an Opinion, concerning which we dare not paſs Sentence. Neither canſt thou ſay, Theſe things are too ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile for my Underſtanding: For, if thou conſidereſt the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it ſelf, whereof we here diſpute, what is more plain and ſimple than it? for, what doth it contain above that which is called the Apoſtles Creed, which Children are acquainted with? namely, that that One God is no other than the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. If you look upon the Arguments which we have drawn out of the Scriptures, they are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves plain and eaſie; ſo that the Adverſaries can no other way decline their force, than by turning away from the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Word, and endeavouring to draw us away from the ſame: Yea, thoſe Arguments vvhich vve have fetch'd from Reaſon, if you except a few vvhich vve have added for the ſake of Learned Men, are ſo clear, that one muſt rather offer violence to his Reaſon and Underſtanding, that he may not admit the force of them, than uſe any great intention of Mind to underſtand them. But perhaps, if any thing occur in the defence of the Arguments fetch'd out of the Scripture, vvhich may to a Man unskill'd in the Art of Diſputing, ſeem ſomewhat ſubtile, he may paſs it by: for the other things vvhich may eaſily be underſtood by every one, vve are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent will be ſufficient for him to paſs ſentence concerning this Cauſe: Though vve have ſo tempered this vvhole kind of Writing, that all things may be underſtood by a man indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently verſed in Learning; even thoſe vvhich in the ſecond Book we have culled out of Philoſophy, and the received Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Schools. Neither indeed is it to be imputed to us, if now and then vve ſpeak ſomething vvhich the ruder ſort may call ſubtile, but to the Adverſaries; vvho, as vve have ſaid, do draw us avvay from the ſimplicity both of the Words and meaning of the Spirit of God, which Reaſon doth dictate to the unlearned themſelves, and by the ſubtilties of diſtinctions endeavour to elude the moſt plain Arguments which we produce for our Opinion: Wherefore we friendly
<pb facs="tcp:64944:5"/> admoniſh and beſeech all them to whom this Writing of ours ſhall come, that they would diligently weigh and examine our Words by the Ballance of the Divine Oracles, and offer no violence to their conſcience, when they have found the Truth, and ſo either by reſiſting it, or perpetually burying it in ſilence, increaſe their own and others ſervitude; but uſe diligence to draw Others, partly to the truer Opinion partly to more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Counſels, and as much as in them lies, cauſe that all may dare to erect their Mind to a free Inquiry touching ſacred Matters, and to lift up their Eyes to the Light thereof: And that ſo through the whole World, Men may with Piety of Mind, Mouth, and Life, praiſe that One God the Father, of whom are all things; and that One Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things: To Him be Glory and Power for ever and ever.</p>

            <head>The Scope AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE WORK.</head>
            <p>THe ſcope of this our Work is to ſhew, That the moſt High God is no other beſides the Father of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. Now we will divide the whole Work into two Books: In the firſt we will confirm our Opinion with Scripture-Teſtimonies, and Arguments drawn thence; In the latter we will make uſe of other ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Reaſons to prove the ſame, and refute the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; Though even there we will now and then recal the Reader to the Scriptures. But in the former part of the Work, we will ſo proceed, as that we will firſt directly prove, That onely the Father of Jeſus Chriſt is the moſt high God; and that partly by thoſe Teſtimonies of the ſacred. Scripture which make open
<pb facs="tcp:64944:6"/> mention of the Father; Partly by thoſe wherein the Name of the Father is not indeed expreſt, yet is he truly ſpoken of. Then will we demonſtrate the ſame indirectly, as they ſay; when we ſhall ſhew out of the ſame holy Scripture, That neither Chriſt, whom otherwiſe we confeſs to be by the Gift of the Father a God over all, to be bleſſed for evermore, is the moſt High God; nor the Holy Spirit, whom we will prove to be the Vertue and Efficacy of the moſt High God. <hi>Book 1. Sect. 3. Chap. 5.</hi> For ſo it will remain that the Father onely is the moſt High God; ſince no other elſe can be imagined.</p>

                        </gap>de the Son and holy Spirit from the ſame Godhead; but only to exclude Idols, or the falſe Gods of the Heathen. For that here the TRUE God is oppoſed to falſe ones. And indeed it is true, that only the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is therefore called the true God, to exclude them from true God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, who were then falſely eſteemed and worſhipped for gods: but nevertheleſs, it is done by Chriſt in ſuch a manner, as is of larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and excludeth not only them, but all others alſo, beſides the Father, from the moſt high Godhead.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore it is given us to underſtand, that if the moſt high God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is attributed to any one beſides the Father of Jeſus Chriſt, it is done erroneouſly. Now as for that which we aſſert, both the force of the words, and the occaſion or cauſe intimated by the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries themſelves doth require. For as to the firſt, ſuch is the force of the word, ONLY, as that it excludeth all others from the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the predicate, beſides him to whom it is applied. But he to whom the word ONLY, if you conſider the ſence (for we will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſpeak of the conſtruction of the words) is applied, is the Father of Jeſus Chriſt, as they themſelves confeſs; with whom we have now to do. And the Predicate is, THE TRUE GOD, or the Moſt High God: Wherefore the word ONLY doth from the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Predicate, exclude all beſides the Father, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt and the holy Spirit. As to the latter; either therefore the gods of the Heathen, are by theſe words of Chriſt underſtood to be excluded from true Godhead, becauſe it is apparent that they are different from the Father, whom Chriſt calleth the only true God; or becauſe it is already apparent that they are falſe gods. Not for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cauſe, for otherwiſe they would be judged already excluded from true Godhead, before they were underſtood to be excluded by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the words of Chriſt, nor would there be need to make uſe of theſe words to that purpoſe. If for the former cauſe, it is neceſſary that all, who are apparently different from the Father of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhould be excluded from that true or moſt high Godhead; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Argument which ſhould from theſe words be drawn to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Idols of the Heathen from the true Godhead, would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid. For it would be thus, if it ſhould by way of Syllogiſm be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: ſome different from the Father of Jeſus Chriſt, are not the true God. The Idols of the Heathen are different from the Father of Jeſus Chriſt; therefore are not the true god. The Major would be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64944:7"/> particular in the firſt figure, which makes the conſequence invalid. Wherefore although the falſe Opinion of the Heathen touching their Idols, gave occaſion to Chriſt, to call his Father the only true God, yet did he ſo ſhape his words, that others alſo might be excluded from <hi>that</hi> true <hi>Godhead?</hi> and not only they, to whom ſupream Godhead was then falſely attributed, but ſuch alſo to whom the ſame might in time to come be likewiſe falſly attributed. For, that we may add this alſo, who doubteth that <hi>Peter</hi> (for example) <hi>Paul, Gabriel, Michael,</hi> are by vertue of theſe words of Chriſt, ſtrongly excluded from the moſt high God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head? But there was then none, that held them to be moſt high Gods; nor conſequently did Chriſt ſpecially intend, to exclude them from the Deity. Wherefore the force of the words and meaning is of a larger extent than the occaſion of them, and is rightly drawn forth to others likewiſe, beſides the Idols of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Neither may any one here ſay, that therefore not only the Idols of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but alſo thoſe Men and Angels, are by vertue of theſe words, excluded from the moſt high Godhead, becauſe they are not of the ſame eſſence or ſubſtance, but that the Son and holy Spirit are not excluded, becauſe they are of the ſame Eſſence with the Father; Since it is agreeable, if any thing be attributed to the Father only, that thoſe perſons ſhould not be excluded from the communion thereof, which have the ſame numerical ſubſtance: For beſides, that this is indeed nothing elſe than to take that for granted which is moſt in controverſie; when Chriſt called his Father the only true God, he meant no leſs the only Perſon of the Father, then the Eſſence or Subſtance, &amp; conſequently no leſs excluded them from that true and moſt high Godhead, who were different Perſons from the Father, then who were different Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For Chriſt uſeth a popular kind of ſpeaking, and applyeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the capacity of his Diſciples. For therefore he with a clear voice uttered Prayers to the Father in their preſence, that he might both inſtruct and comfort them no leſs with this ſupplication to the Father, then he had formerly by ſpeaking to them. But among the people, yea among all, THE FATHER ONLY doth no leſs denote the only perſon of the Father, then the Subſtance; and conſequently doth no leſs exclude all different perſons from the Father, than Subſtances. Beſides, when the Vulgar think of a Perſon different from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they alſo preſently think of a Subſtance different from him. Where they conceive one Subſtance, they cannot think of a different Perſon. Certainly concerning Moods, Subſiſtences, Suppoſitalities and Perſonalities, which exiſting in the ſame numerical Subſtance, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute Perſons really diſtinct, even at this day the vulgar ſort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do not think: ſo unlikely is it, that heretofore among the Jews, even Fiſhermen did know them.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore if Chriſt fitting himſelf to the capacity of the Vulgar, would have all different Subſtances from the Father, be excluded from the moſt high Godhead, he would alſo have all different Perſons from the Father excluded from the ſame. Whence we are given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that in theſe words, the contrary to what is urged in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64944:8"/> is rather taken for granted, namely, that he who is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in Perſon from the Father, as Chriſt is, is alſo diſtinguiſhed from him in Subſtance; and conſequently, by virtue of theſe words of Chriſt, are excluded from that true and moſt high Godhead.</p>
                     <p>And this is ſo much the more to be believed touching Chriſt, in that the Diſciples, who were then preſent, did not only ſee him to be a true man, but alſo heard him diſtinguiſhed from the Father, as a Meſſenger from the Sender; and alſo that he poured out prayers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame, and begged glory of him. Again, if none by vertue of theſe words of Chriſt, is excluded from the true Godhead, although he manifeſtly differ in perſon from the Father, unleſs it be alſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that he is different from him in Eſſence, it will follow, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be confuted by theſe words, who ſhall ſay, that <hi>Gabriel</hi> (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> or finally <hi>Jupiter, Neptune,</hi> or the other gods of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> are the true God, differing indeed from the Father in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but yet of the ſame Eſſence with him; namely, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as they commonly think of Chriſt, or the holy Spirit.</p>
                     <p>But who ſeeth not that ſuch Perſons, whether true or feigned, are by vertue of theſe words of Chriſt, moſt efficaciouſly excluded from the Deity, ſo that one confeſs them to be DIVERS from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>But they ſay, that we our ſelves contend, that if any thing be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to God <hi>only,</hi> it is not preſently denied to them, who depend on him, or are ſubordinate to him, in the number of whom we rank Chriſt. Wherefore although the FATHER ONLY be called the true God, yet is not Chriſt preſently denied to be a true God.

But this Objection, if the thing be rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, is ſo far from overthrowing our Opinion and Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the words of Chriſt, that it doth confirm it. For neither do we hold, that Chriſt is by vertue of theſe words wholy excluded from true Godhead; namely, if true Godhead be more largely taken, ſo as to comprehend that Godhead alſo, which doth indeed, and not only, in the falſe opinion of men, depend on the moſt high Godhead.<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 13.

Wherefore our meaning only is, that Chriſt, by vertue of the words in conteſt, is excluded from that true Deity, by way of excellency ſo called; that is, from Supream and Independent Deity. For by theſe words, firſt, all beſides the Father are held to be excluded from Supream Godhead; and conſequently, from Deity taken more largely, all ſuch who have not received it from the Father; to whom alone ſupream and independent Divinity is ſaid
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64944:8"/> to agree. For he is accounted as Independent, who doth not depend on him, on whom only he can truly depend. Whence all the Idols of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> are by vertue of theſe words, or rather, of the ſence therein comprehended, ſimply excluded from true Godhead; ſince they were ſo far from truly depending on the Father, as that they were not believed to depend. But Chriſt is not excluded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, becauſe his dependance on the Father, in reſpect of his Divine Empire over all things, and Worſhip ſuitable to ſuch an Empire, hath by moſt evident proofs been demonſtrated.</p>
                     <p>Now what we ſpeak touching this place, doth likewiſe come to paſs in others, wherein ſuch Attributes are attributed to God only; which nevertheleſs are communicated to others beſides him. For in them likewiſe, all beſides God are excluded from the Communion of thoſe Attributes taken by way of excellency, and ſtrictly. For God is ſaid to be only wiſe, powerful, having Immortality, not becauſe he alone is ſimply wiſe, powerful, immortal, but becauſe he is only ſuch of himſelf. And therefore all others beſides God, are by vertue of ſuch words, excluded from independent and underived Wiſdom, Power and Immortality; and then at length ſimply and univerſally excluded from thoſe Attributes, when it is apparent that they have not received them from God, to whom they firſt agree, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently do not herein indeed depend on him. A ſeigned Dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is by right accounted for nothing. Whence it is underſtood, what our meaning is, when we ſay, That if any thing is in the Scripture at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God only, it is not preſently denyed to them, who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on God, and ſubordinate to him: For we mean not that ſuch Attributes are in no wiſe denyed unto them; (for they are denied unto them being taken by way of Excellency) but that they are not preſently denyed ſimply and univerſally, or in a larger ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps they with whom we now have to do, will object and ſay, that they do in ſome ſort hold the ſame: For that the Father on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is called the true or moſt high God, becauſe he is the Fountain of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and conſequently in regard thereof hath a Prerogative above the Son and holy Spirit, inaſmuch as They have the Divine Eſſence from Him, but He from no other. For which reaſon they expreſly call the Father <hi>God of himſelf,</hi> thereby oppoſing him to the Son and holy Spirit. But they who anſwer thus, either contradict themſelves, or ſay nothing; and obtrude upon us bare words inſtead of things: for if the Father hath a true Prerogative or Excellency above the Son and holy Spirit, ſo that for it the Name of <hi>GOD</hi> may be attributed to the Father alone, but taken away from the Son and holy Spirit; it cannot be that the Son and holy Spirit ſhould be the ſupream and moſt high God: for nothing in any wiſe more worthy, nothing more excellent than the moſt high God, can poſſibly be imagined: And they themſelves, in <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s Creed, contend that in the Trinity nothing is before or after, nothing greater or leſs: But if the Father is the Fountain of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in reſpect of the Son and holy Spirit, how will there be the ſame
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64944:9"/> Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Divinity of the Father, Son, and holy Spirit? for the Father would be the Fountain of his own Divinity, or Divine Eſſence, before and after himſelf: How, if the Father be the Fountain of the other Perſons, ſhall not the Son and holy Spirit depend on the Father? How ſhall not each be an Effect of the Father? and finally, How ſhall the Son and holy Spirit be the ſupream and moſt high God? for He is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on none, is the Effect of none. But if they will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge theſe things, what elſe do they, then obtrude upon us empty words inſtead of things, and ſo ſay nothing? and upon what ground, I pray, dare they to this purpoſe wreſt the words of the Scripture, which are moſt plain, and expoſed to the capacity of the rudeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding? for how can an ignorant man (that I may not now ſpeak any thing of the Learned) conceive in his mind that the Father only is the moſt high God, when in the mean time he is commanded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that alſo the Son and holy Spirit is the ſame moſt high God? How can he imagine a Prerogative of any one above one who is the moſt high God? How the Prerogative of him above one who is the ſame Numerical God with himſelf? How him to be the Fountain of other Perſons, on whom they do not depend as Effects on a Cauſe? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this is not to teach an ignorant man, but quite to take away his Underſtanding, and to cauſe that he who comprehended ſomething, does now comprehend nothing at all: Which will alſo happen to lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men, if they will endeaver to conſider things, and rather conceive them in their mind, then to cozen themſelves and others with a meer ſound of words. By this alſo it may eaſily be underſtood, how we ought to anſwer them who ſay that the Name of <hi>GOD</hi> is by an attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or an appropriation, as they ſpeak, both here and elſewhere aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the Father, and that, as we now ſuppoſe, to him onely: for either they grant that the Name of <hi>GOD</hi> is by reaſon of the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive which the Father hath above the Son and holy Spirit, attributed to him onely as proper, and ſo tacitly taken away from the Son and holy Spirit; or without any regard to that Prerogative: If the firſt, how they may be refuted, we have already ſpoken; if the latter, they ſhall be able to ſhew by no ſufficient Example, out of either ſacred or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Writers, or out of the vulgar Cuſtom of ſpeaking, that an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute equally common to Many, may be rightly aſcribed to but One of them, in ſuch a manner as that it may be ſaid to agree to him ONLY. Wherefore no regard is to be had to ſuch an attribution in theſe words of Chriſt.</p>

There are therefore ſome who deny that the words of Chriſt before cited, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Opinion, which is admitted by others, namely, That the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Onely is the true God; for they explain the Words in another, and that a two-fold way: Some ſay that the word ONLY doth not belong to the Subject of Chriſts words, which if we conſider the ſence is the Father, but to the Predicate, namely, The TRUE GOD, for that Chriſt doth ſay, That THE FATHER IS THE ONELY TRUE GOD,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64944:9"/> and not THE FATHER ONLY IS THE TRUE GOD: Which firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition doth not hinder, but that the Son alſo, or the holy Spirit may be called the <hi>True God,</hi> yea, the <hi>Onely True God:</hi> Inaſmuch as theſe Propoſitions are not repugnant one to the other, the Father is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true God, and the Son or the holy Spirit is the true God, or the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true God. But<note n="*" place="margin">The third An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> others contend that theſe words are ſo to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and conſtrued, that the ſence may be, <hi>THIS IS LIFE ETER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAL, THAT THEY KNOW THEE, AND WHOM THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> HAST SENT JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, TO BE THE ONLY TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E GOD:</hi> So that theſe words are ſo far from excluding Chriſt from ſupream Deity, that they rather are to be thought expreſly to attribute the ſame unto him; Which Anſwers, what weight they carry with them, let us fee.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt therefore, they are exceedingly miſtaken:<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</note> for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>jective ONLY, as oft as it is imployed to exclude other Subjects from the communion of the Predicate, belongs to the Subject, not the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate. Now that in this place the word <hi>Onely</hi> is imployed to exclude other Subjects, namely, Idols, from the communion the Predicate, which is the <hi>True God,</hi> all the Adverſaries contend; wherefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to the Predicate, but to the Subject, which, if we conſider the ſence, is none but the Father. And that you may more plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the thing, ſee whether by our or their opinion, the Idols or gods of the Gentiles are ſtrongly excluded from true Deity: If you follow our Opinion, the buſineſs is diſpatched<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, if Onely the Father of Chriſt be the true God, certainly Idols cannot ſo be, ſince they are not the Father of Chriſt. But if you follow their Opinion, the buſineſs is not yet diſpatched: for they hold, that notwithſtanding that Propoſition, <hi>THE FATHER IS THE ONLY TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E GOD,</hi> the ſame Predicate may alſo be applied to other Subjects: for that it may nevertheleſs be ſaid THE SON IS THE TRUE GOD, yea, THE ONLY TRUE GOD, in like manner alſo the Holy Spirit. And therefore theſe words of Chriſt would not by themſelves hinder, but that the ſame Predicate might alſo be attributed to infinite other Subjects: ſo that it would not be apparent from theſe words of Chriſt, that Idols are not the true God, but that were wholly to be underſtood from elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps ſome one will ſay, That the Subject, to which the word ONLY is immediately adjoyned, is the name of GOD, not the FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the Predicate from the Communion whereof other Subjects are excluded, is the word TRUE. For that the ſence is, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that God, who only is true. But this ſhift likewiſe is vain, and that for two Reaſons; Firſt, Becauſe the word TRUE is not here ſuch a Predicate, as here ſignifieth any thing by it ſelf, and denoteth ſome peculiar Attribute of any thing, but only together with it, whereto it is adjoyned. For neither doth TRUE in this place ſignifie the ſame with <hi>Trusty,</hi> or <hi>truth ſpeaking;</hi> but when it is oppoſed to a thing that is falſe, or falſely ſo called, it ſignifies nothing but the reality of the thing to which it is annexed. And therefore it is predicated of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by it ſelf, but together with it to which it is annexed which in this place, is God. So that, being taken together with that word, it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64944:10"/> ſignifies him, who in truth and very deed, and not only in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of men, is God. Thus we ſay that Chriſt is a true Man, is the true Meſſiah, and ſo forth. For it is all one as if you ſhould ſay, that he is truly and in very deed a Man, and the Meſſiah; not falſely, nor on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Opinion of Men. Wherefore theſe words, THE TRUE GOD, are not ſo to be parted, as that the one may again conſtitute a Subject, the other a Predicate, and the word ONLY thought to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to that of GOD, that the Predicate of TRUE may be removed from all other Subjects beſides God; but the words TRUE GOD, do joyntly conſtitute one Predicate; and the word ONLY muſt be thought to be annexed unto the Subject thereof, namely, the <hi>Father;</hi> that all other Subjects beſide the Father, may be excluded from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of this Predicate, namely, <hi>The True God.</hi> And indeed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Chriſt was not ſimply to exclude Idols, or the Gods of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then from truth, but to ſhew that they are to be excluded from true Godhead, or not to be accounted true Gods. But if you ſay, the word GOD is again to be repeated, that the ſence may be, That the Father is that God who onely is the true God; what elſe will you do, than make Chriſt to ſpeake that by circuity of words, which any one would ſimply utter, and ſo without neceſſity double both the Subject and the Predicate, referring the Subject again to the Predicate; as if any one ſhould take this ſpeech directed to Chriſt, THAT THEY MAY KNOW THEE THE ONLY TRUE CHRIST OR <hi>MESSIAS,</hi> and rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it thus, THAT THEY MAY KNOW THEE TO BE THAT CHRIST WHICH ONLY IS THE TRUE CHRIST; then ſimply to ſay, THAT THEY MAY KNOW THEE WHO ONLY ART THE TRUE CHRIST OR MESSIAS. For, that we may alſo adde the other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, although the words were ſo to be taken, as if it were ſaid that the Father is that God who only is the true God; yet would it be all one as if it were ſaid, That the Father onely is the true God: As if I ſhould ſay, <hi>Chriſt is that Man who Onely was born of a Virgin,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt is that Man who Onely is the true M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Certain it is, that as often as any one is ſaid to be that, to which onely ſome other thing is attributed, it is all one as if it ſhould be ſaid that both did joyntly agree to that firſt ſubject only.</p>
                     <p>Neither do they quit themſelves handſomely, who feign Examples of this ſort; as namely, That a certain Church (we for inſtance ſake, will take the ancient Church of <hi>Antioch</hi>) is that Church which onely is a true Church, although there be other true Churches extant toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64944:10"/> with it: for they ſay, that we muſt ſpeak thus, <hi>The Church of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch is a Church that onely is true;</hi> namely, becauſe it is of the number of thoſe Churches which onely are true Churches. Thus another would ſay, <hi>Peter is a living Creature which onely is rational,</hi> becauſe he is one of thoſe living Creatures which onely are rational. But thoſe Examples are without Example: for it ſhould be proved by ſome ſufficient Example, either ſacred or prophane, that one may rightly ſpeak in that manner: Out of the Scripture they ſhall not produce an Example, neither do the Vulgar ſpeak ſo: But Chriſt ſpeaks after the Vulgar faſhion.

                        </gap>n we ſay, that any Church onely is a true Church, if ſo be we hold that there are many true Churches by the name of that Church which onely is true, we do not underſtand any particular Church taken ſeparately, but the whole kind or rather ſpecies of that Church: for it cannot be ſaid of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church taken ſeparately, that it onely is a true Church: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would be rightly ſaid, that the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> onely was a true Church, which they themſelves will not admit, who feign ſuch Examples: But that doth agree as proper to that whole ſpecies or kind of Churches, namely, which profeſſeth the ſaving Doctrine of Chriſt, and is rightly ſaid to accord to that onely.</p>
                     <p>Now this which we ſay, is alſo hence apparant, in that when we will attribute to any Church Onely the name of a true Church, we cannot adde to that Church the word <hi>every,</hi> which would ſignifie that the ſame might be affirmed of all Churches ſeparately: for it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to ſay, <hi>Every Church profeſſing the ſaving Doctrine of Chriſt is onely a true Church;</hi> but onely ſimply, A <hi>Church profeſſing the ſaving Doctrine of Chriſt, onely is a true Church:</hi> But when we call the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> a Church, we ſo take the name of the Church, as that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteth a particular Church, and one conſidered ſeparately; or a Church taken diſtributively, not collectively: For one cannot ſeparately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the whole kinde, or ſpecies taken collectively, of any <hi>Individuum.</hi> Wherefore one cannot likewiſe ſay, That the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> is that Church which onely is true. In the ſame manner it is not rightly ſaid, That <hi>Peter</hi> is that living Creature that onely is rational; for <hi>Peter</hi> is not that whole kinde or ſpecies of a living Creature, to which onely it agreeth to be rational: and ſo in the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto therefore it remaineth unſhaken, that in the words of Chriſt this meaning is contained, That the Father only is the true God. We ſay this ſence is contained in theſe words: for that we may adde this likewiſe, which will give great light both to the words of Chriſt, and to our Opinion: Theſe words, <hi>The onely true God,</hi> are put by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the preceeding word, <hi>Thee,</hi> deſigning the Father; as if it were ſaid, <hi>Who onely art the True God:</hi> And therefore the article ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the word <hi>onely</hi> in the Greek, ſheweth that the ſame thing is again deſcribed, as it is elſewhere wont to come to paſs in appoſitions. You have a place very like to this, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. where, when <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Which</hi> (namely, the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>in his times he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64944:11"/> will ſhew, who is the bleſſed and onely Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</hi> he addeth, <hi>Who onely hath Immortality:</hi> Where every one ſeeth that theſe words agree with the former by appoſition, and that the article in the Greek ſerveth to joyn this new deſcription of God with thoſe going before, and that the word <hi>Onely</hi> is referred to the ſubject; Wherefore let none imagine that we think that the word <hi>one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> if we conſider the grammatical conſtruction, is to be connected with the precedent word <hi>Thee:</hi> for both the article ſet before the word <hi>only</hi> doth hinder, and by this means we muſt underſtand the Verb TO BE: For it would be all one as if Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>Thee only to be the true God;</hi> which though it is by it ſelf true, will yet preſently after ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be diſagreeable unto the ſence of this place.</p>
                     <p>For now it is time to examine and confute their Opinion likewiſe, who ſo take theſe words, as if Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>This is life eternal that they know thee (Father) and him whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt, to be the only true God.</hi> Firſt, we ſay, that this Explication cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſiſt, becauſe it refers the word <hi>Only</hi> to the Predicate; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>The true God,</hi> which we before ſhewed was to be referred to the Subject. But if any one will ſo take the word, as if it were ſaid, <hi>Thee, and whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt only,</hi> to be the true God; Firſt, the placing of the word <hi>Only</hi> doth hinder it; for when the word <hi>Only</hi> is referred to many ſubjects at once, it is wont either to be ſet after all, as we even now did, or to be ſet before all. Which latter happeneth in thoſe words of <hi>Paul,</hi> which are alone brought by ſome to illuſtrate their Explication of this place, and are extant, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. for thus it is there to be read out of the <hi>Greek, Or have only I and Barnabas no power to forbear working?</hi> But in this place of ours, not alone the word <hi>only,</hi> but together the whole Predicate, namely, <hi>The true God,</hi> is interpoſed between theſe two Subjects, to which it is thought to be referred; that is to ſay, between the word <hi>Thee,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom the Father hath ſent. To omit, that the Article ſet before the word <hi>only,</hi> doth not ſuffer, that it ſhould be in that manner joyned either with the word <hi>Thee,</hi> or with the words <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> as all who are not ignorant of the Greek Tongue will confeſs.</p>
                     <p>Again, By this means notwithſtanding, the Opinion of the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries touching the Deity of the holy Spirit, will be overthrown: for if the Father and Chriſt only be the true God, the holy Spirit cannot alſo he. The ſame will alſo follow, although you ſo take the words, as if Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>That they know thee (Father) and whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to be that God who only is the true God. For we have before ſhown, that this is all one as if it had been ſaid, <hi>Thee and Jeſus Chriſt only to be the true God;</hi> there is, I ſay, no difference in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, whether the word <hi>Only</hi> be preſently added to the firſt Subject, or to that Subject which is part of the Predicate. Beſides, it is falſe, That Eternal Life, or the Way to attain Eternal Life, doth herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, that men know the Father and Chriſt to be the only true God: Properly taken it cannot conſiſt; otherwiſe it would be both neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64944:11"/> requiſite, and alſo ſufficient to acknowledge the Father and Chriſt for the only true God. But by this account, all, who comprehend that Opinion in their minds, ſhould attain Eternal Life, when never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they may withal ſtick in thoſe vices, concerning which the Scripture openly pronounceth, that they who do ſuch things, ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>You will ſay therefore, that it is to be taken improperly, that this knowledge may comprehend in it ſelf faith in Chriſt, working by love and all kind of vertues; namely, by a <hi>Metonimy</hi> or <hi>Tranſnomination</hi> joyned with a <hi>Synecdoche;</hi> whereby under the name of the cauſe, the effect is alſo comprehended. After which manner Eternal Life ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Scripture to be aſcribed to that Faith whereby men believe, That<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31.</note> Jeſus is the Chriſt the Son of God. But neither can this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, for even ſo nevertheleſs, it would be ſignified, that this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is neceſſary for all unto eternal Life, and a certain ground of faith working by Love: But that this is falſe, doth hence appear, in that not only Chriſt himſelf, who was ſent by God to declare unto men the way of Salvation, and implant in them Saving-Faith, did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>never openly deliver, or inculcato to men this Doctrine; yea, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Apoſtles, the moſt clear Preachers both of his Divinity and Doctrine. For as to Chriſt, he did not only of his own accord not teach and inculcate, that he together with the Father, is the only true God, but alſo when a commodious occaſion was afforded him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that concerning himſelf, did yet abſtain from ſo doing, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch a manner of himſelf, as that he openly differenced himſelf from God, taken by way of excellency, and ſhewed that himſelf wholly depended on him; as appeareth from the 10th chapter of this very Goſpel, verſe 33, &amp;c. concerning which words we have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where<note n="*" place="margin">In the Book of God and his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes <hi>chap. 13.</hi>

                     <p>I forbear to urge (what we will elſewhere demonſtrate) that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the prayers which Chriſt here poureth out to the Father, nor his ſending from the Father, whereof in theſe very words he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention, do admit, that Chriſt ſhould be accounted the true and ſupream God, together with the Father. I will only here ſpeak, what hath in ſome meaſure been obſerved by certain very learned Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, namely, that it is not agreeable to this place, that Chriſt ſhould pronounce concerning himſelf, that he together with the Father is the only true God; partly becauſe he prayeth to the Father, and ſo ſpeaketh moſt modeſtly of himſelf; partly becauſe he conſidereth and deſcribeth himſelf as the Fathers Embaſſador. For praying to the Father, he is not to be thought to have equalized himſelf to the Father, and to have pronounced that of himſelf, then which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath nothing greater, but as it became one that is very modeſt, and a ſupplicant, to have ſet himſelf below him. Furthermore, in that he here conſidereth and deſcribeth himſelf as the Fathers Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, he is not to be thought to have attributed unto himſelf the ſupream Majeſty and Glory of the Father that ſent him, which herein conſiſteth that he is the only true God. Beſides, both the order and the meetneſs of the ſpeech, doth require that the firſt deſcription ſhould be proper to the Father, to whom it is immediately joyned, as the latter is peculiar to Chriſt, and not Chriſt be deſcribed both in a peculiar manner; and again, in ſuch an one, as is common to him with the Father, and that in thoſe words, which, if you reſpect the order, ſeem no leſs properly to be attributed to the Father, than the latter to Chriſt. And the firſt of theſe three Reaſons was in ſome meaſure toucht by a moſt accute and learned popiſh<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>John Maldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat</hi> on this place</note> Interpreter. For amongſt other cauſes, for which Chriſt in this place called not himſelf, but the Father, the only true God, he alledgeth this alſo, that Chriſt would, <hi>as it became a Son, ſpeak honorably of his Father, but very modestly of himſelf; (wherefore ſaith he) he called not himſelf God, but the Father. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the ſame account, I ſuppoſe, neither would he name himſelf; for he ſaid, not that they may know thee and me, but that they may know thee, and whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt, ſpeaking of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the third Perſon, which argueth greater modeſty than to name him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he treateth of honorable things, ſuch as this was.</hi> But if Chriſt is to be thought to have here regarded Modeſty in ſo ſmall a matter, how much more in not ſaying, that he together with the Father, is that only true and moſt high God? although Chriſt would not only have regard to modeſty, but to the very thing it ſelf; for he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64944:12"/> would joyn himſelf to the Father, and the knowledge of himſelf to that of the Father, in ſuch a manner, as that he might withal ſhew what difference there was between them: for he would ſignifie that the Father is to be known as the ſupream Monarch and Prince of all things, and that his will is to be regarded by its ſelf; but that he himſelf was to be looked upon as his Embaſſador, who declareth his will, and demonſtrateth it by moſt certain proofs, being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the name of God, to execute and compleat the ſame; for ſuch deſcriptions of Perſons in the Scripture, are not wont to be idle, but fitted to illuſtrate the thing that is treated of. But enough of this.</p>
                     <p>He that liketh plain Interpretations of the Scripture, cannot chuſe but reject this which we oppoſe, and imbrace ours, unleſs he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his pre-conceived opinion concerning that thing, before any proof whatſoever.</p>

But doth he rightly explain a thing, who omitteth not only as much, but more alſo then he expreſſeth, when in the mean time that which he omitteth, is neceſſary to explain the thing, and inſtead of three Perſons, mentioneth but one; as the Apoſtle by this account would do? Who, I pray you, of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, when he is to explain who that one God is, doth ſo handle the matter, as that he maketh mention of the Father only, and ſaith, that there is one God, namely, the Father of Jeſus Chriſt? which of them doth not or would not rather ſay thus, there is one God, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Father, Son and holy Spirit? for indeed, he ought ſo to ſpeak, if he will ſpeak agreeable to his Opinion: But had the Apoſtle been of the ſame Opinion with the Adverſaries, he ſhould rather have ſpoken ſo, to avoid the giving of occaſion to this Opinion of ours; which (as they imagine) is an errour ſo grievous and peſtilent, namely, that that one God ſhould be accounted one no leſs in Perſon than in Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and believed to be no other than the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; eſpecially ſince the diſtinction of a Perſon from its Eſſence was not then commonly known, or to ſpeak more rightly was not yet invented: and beſides, it might juſtly be doubted of the Son and holy Spirit, whether they were the moſt high God, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was confeſſed amongſt all, that both do proceed from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, partly becauſe the Apoſtles did moſt frequently diſtinguiſh both from God ſimply ſo called, by calling the one the Son of God, the other the Spirit of God: Wherefore that moſt faithful Teacher, who was moſt ſtudious of mens ſalvation, ought not to ſpeak ſo danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and give to the faithful an occaſion of ſo great and pernicious an Errour, as they are pleaſed to ſtile it. From whence alſo it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that that is nothing which ſome here anſwer; namely, that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64944:13"/> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid by an Attribution or Appropriation, as they call it, that that one God is the Father; for by this courſe he had not at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the vulgar ſort of Chriſtians, but had rather, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, intangled them with moſt grievous errour; for of that Attribution which is here held, the Vulgar doth not underſtand the reaſon, ſince many of the very Learned themſelves have not ſo much as heard of it: So that it was not worth the while, to uſe this figure to the detriment of the thing it ſelf. In explaining of things, all faithful Teachers ſtudy clearneſs; and that the more, the greater the things are, and the greater the danger is that may accrue from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity.</p>
                     <p>But who was more faithful than the Apoſtle? What was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the things treated of? What Errour, eſpecially if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our Adverſaries, more grievous? What Danger more prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial? Beſides, what kind of Attribution or Appropriation is this? is it ſuch a one, that a word of a ſtricter ſignification, namely, <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> ſhould be a larger word, and actually comprehending in it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons, namely, <hi>God,</hi> be joyned by appoſition, or ſimply predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated of it? But by what inſtance will they ſhew, that this may rightly be done? Indeed the name of an Individual is ſometimes wont to he adjoyned to the name of the Species; as the name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to the word <hi>Man:</hi> but then the name of the Species doth not actually comprehend many Individuals, but only denoteth ſome one Individual comprehended under it. But if they ſay that the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation lies herein, namely, that the word <hi>God,</hi> which otherwiſe is common to many perſons in number, that is, to the Father, Son and holy Spirit, is here taken as proper to one, to wit, the Father. Firſt, they take that for granted, which is not only controverted, but alſo falſe, and ought to be accounted contrary to theſe very words of <hi>Paul;</hi> namely, that the name <hi>God,</hi> when it is put for the moſt high God, is common to many perſons in number; ſo that it may univo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, or eſſentially be predicated of each: in which manner they hold that the Father is God, and the Son God, and the holy Spirit God. For ſince the moſt high God is but <hi>one</hi> in number, and is ſo here by <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to be, he cannot in that manner be predicated of many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct in number; for one in number cannot be univocally predicated of many differing in number, ſince that it is proper only to the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and the Genus, or rather to that which is one in Genus or Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
                     <p>Again, by this means, that aforeſaid Anſwer to our Argument, namely, that the Apoſtle ſaith not, that that one God is the Father on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, falleth to the ground; for if the word God, is in this place taken as proper to the Father, certainly it is agreeable to his mind to ſay, that that one God is the Father only: for if he were not the Father only, but alſo the Son and holy Spirit, then the word <hi>God</hi> would not be taken as proper to the Father, but as common to the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.

                        <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that which we affirm, namely, <hi>That that one God is the Father
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64944:14"/> Only;</hi> or reciprocally, <hi>That the Father only is that one God;</hi> but only to diſpute with us concerning the ſence of this very aſſertion. Furthermore, if the word <hi>God</hi> is here uſed as proper to the Father, it is either taken by way of excellency, and ſignifieth that Perſon which is the fountain of the others: or without any regard to that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, is ſimply put for the Father. If the firſt be ſaid, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewn in the foregoing Chapter, that they who ſo ſpeak, do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contradict themſelves, and hold the Father only to be indeed the moſt high God, or ſay nothing to the purpoſe. If the latter, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had not ſpoken to the thing in hand; for the queſtion was not, whether there be one Father, but whether there be one God; as is manifeſt from the preceding words of the Apoſtle, though even on the firſt account the Apoſtle had not ſpoken to the matter; for the queſtion was not, whether there were but one, that was the fountain of other perſons, endued with ſupream Deity; but ſimply, whether there were one or more, who indeed had ſupream Deity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently were originally and by themſelves capable of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto we have explained and defended one reaſon chiefly whereby their anſwer is confuted, who denied it to be the meaning of <hi>Pauls</hi> words, <hi>That that one God is the Father only.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another reaſon is, that if you will ſay, that that one God is not the Father only, but alſo other Perſons; namely, the Son and holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, you muſt of neceſſity fall into one of theſe two abſurdities; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſay, that the Father is not that one God, nor likewiſe the Son, nor the holy Spirit; or that every one of theſe Perſons is both the Father, and Son, and holy Spirit: for when you aſſert, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith not, that that one God is the Father only, but only that that one God is the Father, either you hold that the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Apoſtle is not proper, but by a Synecdoche, one Perſon of the Trinity is put for the whole Trinity; whereas the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per expreſſion would be this, That one God is the Father, Son and holy Spirit, or the whole Trinity; or elſe you ſuppoſe this expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That one God is the Father, to be proper; but yet not ſuch, but that we may notwithſtanding properly ſay, that one God is the Son, that one God is the holy Spirit. If you hold the firſt, either every Perſon of the Trinity is the whole Trinity, or is not that one God: For thus we may argue, That one God is the whole Trinity, or the Father Son and holy Spirit joyntly. But the Father is that one God; therefore the Father is the whole Trinity. There is the like reaſoning concerning the Son and holy Spirit. But if you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the concluſion to be abſurd, you muſt deny the Minor; which is partly confirmed out of the Scripture, partly out of your Opinion. For thus we may reaſon; That one God is the whole Trinity. The Father is not the whole Trinity: Therefore the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not that one God. In like manner may we diſcourſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Son and holy Spirit. If you hold the latter, we will thus reaſon; That one God is the Father; That one God is the Son and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64944:14"/> holy Spirit; Therefore the Son and holy Spirit are the Father; and contrariwiſe.</p>
                     <p>Now we add not in the concluſion the particle, <hi>Some one,</hi> becauſe the terms are ſingular. But if you will not admit the concluſion as being abſurd, you muſt again deny the Minor: For thus we will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; That one God is the Father. The Son and holy Spirit are not the Father; Therefore the Son and holy Spirit are not that one God. In like manner we may alſo conclude thus concerning the Father, That one God is the Son, or holy Spirit. The Father is not the Son, nor the holy Spirit; Therefore the Father is not that one God.</p>
                     <p>The third Reaſon may be fetched from the following words; For if that one God were not only the Father, but alſo ſome other, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Chriſt would be he. But Chriſt is here manifeſtly diſtinguiſhed from that one God; and ſo is demonſtrated not to be that one God, whilſt it is added, <hi>And One Lord Jeſus Chriſt: by whom are all things: and we by him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But whereas they ſay, that theſe very words intimate, that when that one God is called the Father, the Son or holy Spirit is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the ſame Godhead; becauſe neither here, where that one Lord is called Jeſus Chriſt, the Father is excluded from the ſame Lordſhip; they are therein exceedingly miſtaken, inaſmuch as the word <hi>Lord</hi> doth in this place denote him who is ſomewayes inferiour to the moſt high God, and ſubordinate to him in dominion, although he be next to him; that is, ſignifieth him: by whom the moſt high God governeth all things any way belonging to the Salvation of Men. But in this manner that one God is not Lord, ſince he cannot in any ſort be inferiour and ſubordinate to himſelf: wherefore he is rightly excluded by the following words from ſuch a Lordſhip. And what we have ſpoken, is proved by a twofold Reaſon drawn from this very place. For firſt, <hi>That one Lord,</hi> is either the ſame with that one God, or ſome way inferiour to him. The ſame he is not, otherwiſe there will be no ground of diſtinction, nor would there be any cauſe, why that one God ſhould be ſaid to be the Father, and that one Lord, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; for no leſs that one Lord, than that one God, ſhould be ſaid to be the Father; for what reaſon there was, why that one God ſhould be ſaid to be the Father, the ſame would there alſo be, for which that one Lord ſhould be ſaid to be the Father: It remaineth therefore, that it ſignifieth him, who is ſome way inferiour to that one God. Again, The ſame is proved by the deſcriptions which are added to both; that is, both to the Father and to Chriſt; and by which they are diſtinguiſhed one from another; for, as we hinted in the former Chapter, the Deſcriptions that are added to things or Perſons in the Scripture, are not wont to be either idle, or forreign to the thing which is treated of, but fitted to illuſtrate or prove the ſame. In this place, if theſe deſcriptions make any thing to the purpoſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Father is he, <hi>of whom are all things, and we to him,</hi> and Chriſt he, <hi>by whom are all things, and we by him,</hi> they ſhew that the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64944:15"/> Father is that one God, and Chriſt that one Lord; as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, To us there is one God, namely, the Father, in as much as all things are of him, and we conſequently to him; and there is alſo to us one Lord, namely, Jeſus Chriſt, in as much as all things are by him, and we conſequently by him; for it is neceſſary that he ſhould be that one God, <hi>of whom are all things;</hi> that is, who is the firſt and higheſt efficient cauſe of all thoſe things which pertain to us Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (for that he hath a peculiar regard to Chriſtians, the word <hi>We</hi> ſeveral time repeated doth intimate) and conſequently <hi>to whom,</hi> as the ultimate Scope we ought to look, and to confer all worſhip and honour: For he is to be accounted by us the moſt high God, who is the firſt and higheſt Cauſe, as of other things, ſo of thoſe, namely, which belong to us and our Salvation. He alſo is to be accounted <hi>One,</hi> who is the higheſt Cauſe, not only of ſome things, but of all; for if he were not <hi>one,</hi> ſome would proceed from him, others from another, as the prime Author and higheſt Cauſe; and conſequently, the glory of thoſe things ought by us to be referred partly to him, partly to the other. Now that we have one Lord, even Chriſt, is thence evident, becauſe all things are by him; that is, becauſe he is the middle cauſe of all thoſe things which belong to us and our ſalvation, and in that all things are governed &amp; diſpenced by him from that firſt Cauſe of all things. Where alſo it followeth, that we by him ought likewiſe to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God; that is, that he is the middle ſcope and end of the honour, which ought by us to be exhibited unto God: for becauſe all things are by <hi>him,</hi> it is apparent not only that he is Lord, but alſo that one Lord; for if there were many, ſome things would be adminiſtred by him, others by another, and ſo we ought to worſhip God partly by him, partly by another. Now who ſeeth not that theſe things are very ſuitable to the words and ſcope of the Apoſtle? Neither can any one here object, that it is alſo ſaid ſometimes concerning the moſt high God, that <hi>all things are by him;</hi> for it is certain it ſignifieth not, that ſome other who is the ſupream Cauſe, doth effect thoſe things by the moſt high God. But it is frequently ſaid of Chriſt in the Scripture, that ſome other, namely, God or the Father, who cannot chuſe but be the ſupream Cauſe, doth do ſomething by him, which properly belongeth to a ſecond cauſe. Concerning which thing, we will hereafter treat more largely in its<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.</note> place.</p>
                     <p>But that in theſe words of <hi>Paul</hi> it is not upon the ſame account ſaid, <hi>that all things are done by Chriſt,</hi> as it is elſewhere ſaid of God, is very evident; becauſe in this place thoſe expreſſions, <hi>Of whom are all things, and by whom are all things;</hi> and alſo thoſe, <hi>We to him,</hi> and <hi>we by him,</hi> are oppoſed the one to the other, and put to diſtinguiſh divers perſons. Wherefore neither is that which is applied to the Father, common to Chriſt; nor that which is applied to Chriſt, ſo taken, as that it may he common to the Father. But this will come to paſs no other way, than if the words annexed to the Father, ſignifie that he is the prime efficient cauſe of all things, and the ultimate end of us and our Religion: and thoſe things which are annexed unto Chriſt, ſignifie
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64944:15"/> that which the propriety of the words requireth; namely, that he is the middle efficient Cauſe of all things, and the intermediate end of our Religion. From whence it is how underſtood, that that one God ſignifieth him, who is the prime efficient Cauſe of all things, and the ultimate end; and that that one Lord ſignifieth him, who is the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle efficient Cauſe of all things, and likewiſe the intermediate end of the Worſhip that is to be performed to God from us; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the one is ſuperiour and greater, the other ſome waies inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and leſs. And indeed the greateſt part of Interpreters of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſeem to acknowledge this ſignification of that Lorſhip which is peculiarly attributed to Chriſt; for as oft as they read that Chriſt is made Lord, or Authority and a Kingdom given unto him, or that he ſhall at length deliver the Kingdom to God the Father, they uſually ſay, that it is there ſpoken of that Lordſhip or Kingdom over the Church, which is peculiarly granted unto him, as mediator, by the Father. Since therefore ſuch a Lordſhip agreeth to Chriſt only, why may he not in regard thereof, be called that <hi>One Lord,</hi> eſpecially in this place; where, as we have ſeen, that one Lord is openly diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that one God; and without making mention of any other, is ſaid to be Jeſus Chriſt, and Chriſt himſelf is looked upon as he, by whom are all things, and by whom God is to be worſhipped of us; which is proper to a Mediator, as they commonly take the word; where finally there is a plain relation to us Chriſtians and the Church. Wherefore it is evident enough, that the Father is not that one Lord which is here ſpoken of, nor doth the ſame Lordſhip which is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to Chriſt agree to him. Which being ſo, what they ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that one Lord, is ſo far from overthrowing our opinion which we hold is contained in the former words, ſpeaking of that <hi>one God,</hi> that it much confirms it; for if when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that there is one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, his purpoſe was to ſignifie, that that Lord is no other but Jeſus Chriſt; in like manner alſo when he ſaith; <hi>That we have one God, even the Father,</hi> his purpoſe was to ſignifie that that God was no other but the Father, for there is the ſame force and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the words; neither hath the one leſs force to exclude others than the other,</p>
                     <p>Before we go hence, we muſt briefly explain, how that one Lord is diſtinguiſhed from that one God, when notwithſtanding the name of <hi>Lord</hi> altogether ſeemeth here to be taken by way of excellency, for otherwiſe there would be many Lords; as <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf in the precedent words, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. did declare. But the name of <hi>Lord</hi> taken by way of excellency, ſeemeth to ſignifie no other than the moſt high God; and that independent Monarch. We anſwer, that the name of <hi>Lord,</hi> when it is put as proper to Chriſt, is taken by way of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but only in reſpect of other Lords, who are ſo far forth of the ſame kind with him, as they have received their Lordſhip from the moſt high God, and conſequently depend on him: For that Chriſt is of the ſame rank, the Scriptures moſt manifeſtly teſtifie; and we, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after producing moſt clear<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.</note> teſtimonies thereof, will demonſtrate.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64944:16"/> Wherefore whatſoever that Excellency be, which is contained in the word <hi>Lord</hi> when it is put for Chriſt, or attributed to him only, yet is it not of ſo large extent, nor ſo ſublime, as to comprehend an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſupream and independent Lordſhip, ſuch as is proper to the moſt high God? and conſequently neither doth the name of <hi>Lord</hi> in that ſence agree to the moſt high God, but is diſtinguiſhed from him. Thus namely, Is it come to paſs, that ſince the name of <hi>God</hi> doth in its own nature ſignifie ſomething more excellent and noble, than the bare name of <hi>Lord,</hi> that the name <hi>God</hi> taken by way of excellency, ſhould denote him, who hath an Empire altogether independent, and is the prime efficient of all things: But the name of <hi>Lord</hi> diſtinguiſhed from him, who is called God by way of excellency, ſhould by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain preheminency deſign him, who amongſt the Lords dependent on God, holdeth the firſt rank, and is far ſublimer than all the reſt. Concerning which thing we could ſay more, but that we muſt haſten to ſomewhat elſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Refutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſecond Anſwer.</note>For now we muſt examine the other Anſwer to our Argument drawn from this place of <hi>Paul;</hi> which is, that <hi>Father</hi> in this place is not taken for the Father of Jeſus Chriſt, but comprizeth the whole Trinity: Which anſwer, that it ſhould come into any ones head, is a wonder: certainly it is altogether inexcuſable unto them, who boaſt that they teach nothing but the meer word of God, and are wont to object to us that following reaſon, <hi>We depart from the Word of God, and wreſt the Scripture;</hi> for what is it to ſpeak beſides the Scripture, and to depart from the plain and obvious meaning thereof, if this be not? for by what inſtance will they ever prove that the word <hi>Father,</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God, doth ſignifie three Perſons of Divinity? The places are obvious to any one, wherein the word <hi>Father</hi> either abſolutely taken, or manifeſtly related to us (which they hold is here tacitly done) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteth the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And indeed the ſame is the Father both of Chriſt and us; as Chriſt himſelf teacheth in<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. ver. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>John,</hi> and many other things demonſtrate. Since therefore this ſignification of the word <hi>Father,</hi> is notorious to all, and moſt uſual in the Scripture, but that other can by no ſufficient inſtance be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated; what came into their heads, that leaving that, they ſhould imbrace this, or rather deviſe it, and that in ſuch a place, where <hi>Paul</hi> intended clearly to explain who that <hi>One God</hi> is, and conſequently to uſe the known ſignification of the word? indeed they alledge pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they think God is for the Creation called Father; but here, they ſay, reſpect is had to Creation, ſince <hi>all things</hi> are ſaid <hi>to be of him.</hi> But this latter is taken without proof; for the word <hi>All</hi> is wont to be referred to the ſubject matter, and to be reſtrained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. But here it is ſpoken of <hi>us;</hi> that is, Chriſtians, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of things peculiarly belonging unto Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Again, They do not prove, that the Father, who is ſo called for Creation, is any other than the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Certainly we ſee how in that which is called <hi>The Apoſtles Creed,</hi> the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64944:16"/> ſame is called the Father Almighty, and the Creator of Heaven and Earth, and Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to be his Son; yea, they themſelves, though they make creation, and the other actions, which are performed out of God, common to the whole Trinity, do yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that creation is peculiarly attributed to the Father, redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Son, ſanctification to the holy Spirit. Wherefore although God ſhould in this place be called Father for Creation, yet would there be no cauſe why we ſhould imagine any other beſides the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be underſtood: but there would rather be great caus why we ſhould think that he is peculiarly to be meant.</p>
                     <p>Though furthermore, there is either no place at all, or ſcarce any in the whole Scripture, wherein, for the firſt Creation only, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they ſpeak, God is called either ſimply Father, or our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but for other fatherly benefits of his toward men, who call him their Father, and for a certain Creation, not common to all men, but peculiar to his People. Certainly in the new Teſtament, it may be juſtly denied, that God is any where, for the firſt Creation only, either ſimply called Father, or our Father in particular; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the cauſes of that appellation are alledged, others are alledged beſides the firſt Creation. Finally, they ſhall no where ſhew, that Chriſt is ſimply called Father, but only once in<note n="*" place="margin">

As for the holy Spirit, they do ſo ſlightly prove that he is the Father, that I am even ſorry to mention what they alledge. The cheifeſt &amp; almoſt only proof is, that we are regenerated by him, and that Chriſt ſaith<note n="*" place="margin">

                        <hi>Peter</hi> writeth, <hi>That we are born again not of corruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever.</hi> The ſame reaſon would alſo be of force in generation properly ſo called. Wherefore as oft as it is written, that Chriſt, for example ſake, was born <hi>of the Seed</hi> of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>David</hi> would be accounted the Father of Chriſt; So in the reſt. But if they cannot prove that the holy Spirit is the Father, or may rightly be ſo called, how much leſs will they be able to prove, that he is any where deſigned by, or comprehended under the name of Father, when the Father is uſed to deſign a certain ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as here it is done?</p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:64944:17"/>
                     <p>But furthermore, although ſuch a ſignification of this word were ſomewhere found, yet would it here have no place where the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is manifeſtly diſtinguiſhed from Chriſt, and that by a certain mark; for the Father eſſentially taken, as they ſpeak, doth in their opinion alſo include Chriſt: But he is here in ſuch a manner, as we have before diſcuſſed, oppoſed to the Father, and contra diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from him as they ſpeak. Finally, there lies a contradiction in this opinion of theirs: for either the <hi>Father,</hi> of whom they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe words, is a Perſon, or is not: If he is a Perſon, why do they oppoſe him to the Father, taken perſonally? why do they not ſuffer him to be the Father of Chriſt; for either he is one Perſon, or more: if one, what other can be here underſtood beſides the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſt? If more, he muſt not be called Father, but Fathers.</p>
                     <p>But if he be not a Perſon, he is not the Father; for every father, though figuratively ſo called, if he be indued with underſtanding, is a Perſon; for a father is ſo called for ſome action, and chiefly for generation, either properly or figuratively ſo called. But ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons agree to none but Suppoſitums; that is, prime Subſtances com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat; as we will explain in its<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>This hath been noted by the Interpreters of the Scripture, both in ſundry other places, and alſo in thoſe by name wherein theſe two words, namely, <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Father</hi> are joyned together.

                  <p>Now that in this place to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> one and the ſame is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the name of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Father,</hi> firſt is apparent, in that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh joyntly concerning the Unity of the one and the other, and not diſtinctly, as in all the other things whereof he made mention. <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid (intending afterwards to demonſtrate the thing) that Chriſtians ought, being knit together with the bond of peace, to maintain ſpiritual Union, and addeth to that purpoſe, <hi>that there is One Body,</hi> and <hi>One Spirit, as they were alſo called in one hope of their Calling: One Lord, One Faith, One Baptiſm, One God and Father of all.</hi> Why did he not likewiſe ſay, as in the reſt, <hi>There is one God, one Father of all,</hi> if he did underſtand one by the name of <hi>God,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the name of the <hi>Father?</hi> The ſame is alſo evident, in that he here diſtinguiſheth that <hi>One God</hi> both from that <hi>One Lord,</hi> and that <hi>One Spirit,</hi> and that in ſuch a manner, as not only to deſign them by divers appellations, and to include them in divers members of the ſentence, but alſo to interpoſe other things between them, that it might the more clearly appear, that they are different the one from the other.</p>
                  <p>But we ſaw in the foregoing Chapter, that Chriſt is by name under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by that <hi>one Lord,</hi> what other then ſhould be underſtood, by that <hi>One God,</hi> diſtinguiſhed both from that <hi>One Spirit,</hi> and alſo from that <hi>One Lord,</hi> or Chriſt, but the Father of Chriſt? eſpecially ſince the very name of the Father is by the Apoſtle himſelf expreſly added. For leſt you ſhould underſtand the whole Trinity by the name of <hi>that God,</hi> who is called <hi>One,</hi> the foreſaid Reaſon doth forbid; namely, in that two Perſons of the Trinity were already mentioned, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from that <hi>one God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, How abſurd would ſuch a ſpeech be, <hi>There is one Trinity of all, and Father?</hi> for to omit that a Trinit, ya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>The Defence of the Argument.</head>
                     <p>BUt there are not wanting ſome, who in this place alſo do by the Name of the <hi>Father,</hi> underſtand the whole Trinity, or the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head indiſtinctly taken. Which how abſurdly they do, though it may be underſtood by the Defence of the foregoing Argument, yet is it here alſo to be ſhewn; chiefly becauſe the principal Patrons of that Opinion have proceeded ſo far, as to ſay, that by <hi>One Spirit, One Lord, One God, and Father,</hi> the very ſame is here underſtood, there being no diſtinction in the thing it ſelf, but only in the words. How bold and abſurd that Explication of <hi>Pauls</hi> words is, would be hard to utter. But ſo was it neceſſary for them to do, who were reſolved to hold their Poſition, and to defend any thing which the Opinion that they had once ſet down, did require.</p>
                     <p>We forbear to urge, that three perſons, every one whereof is a Spirit, Lord, God, Father, cannot poſſibly be one Spirit, Lord, God, Father, as they take it for granted.</p>
                     <p>Our demand only is, By what Example they extend the name of the Spirit or the Father to the three Perſons? As for the name of the <hi>Father,</hi> we ſpake of it in the forgoing Chapter: from whence let thoſe things be fetcht, that are pertinent to this matter.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall find that the name of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> one while put ſimply, another while with an additament, is in infinite places taken for the holy Spirit, but no where for the Father or Chriſt. Indeed the word <hi>Spirit</hi> is<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24.</note> once in the Scripture predicated of the Father<note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17.</note> twice in a different ſence of Chriſt: but put ſubjectively, or deſigning a certain ſubject which is the Spirit, it is no where underſtood of Chriſt, nor the Father. Is it then lawful to reject the moſt uſual ſignification of words, which it is very apparent that <hi>Paul</hi> here followed, and to impoſe ſuch a one upon the words as is no where extant? Beſides, what cauſe can be alledged, why the Apoſtle had rather repeat the ſame thing thrice, than diſtinctly to reckon up three diſtinct things, which might be expreſſed by the ſame words, and each whereof was very pertinent to the buſineſs in hand? why, I ſay, had he rather thrice to name God indiſtinctly, and only heap up words, than to mention firſt the Unity of the holy Spirit, under the name of <hi>One Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> than that of Chriſt, under the name of <hi>One Lord,</hi> afterward that of the <hi>Father,</hi> under this very name? Furthermore, why did the Apoſtle ſeparate theſe three by the interpoſal of other things? why did he not at leaſt conjoyn them, and ſpeak of their Unity in a continued courſe? The other things which he joyntly mentioned, we ſee are divers, thoſe which he mentioned apart, ſhall we think the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64944:18"/> ſame? We know indeed that the ſame thing is ſometimes repeated with changes of words; but when like things are reckoned up in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and each of the reſt finiſhed in particular members, or<note n="*" place="margin">That is Points or Stops.</note> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes, the ſame thing is not wont to be repeated in divers members like to the reſt; much leſs to be ſundred by the interpoſal of like things and Commaes. No ſuch example ſhall be alledged either out of prophane or ſacred Writers Add hereunto, that the ſame thing is then wont to be by ſacred Writers ſo ſignificantly repeated, (as here it will come to paſs) when in each word there is ſome peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar force which here hath no place. Certainly there will be no force in the word <hi>Spirit;</hi> as ſhall preſently be underſtood: And ſhould the name of that <hi>One Lord</hi> here ſignifie the ſame with that <hi>One God,</hi> and ſo deſign the ſupream Monarch of all things, the whole force thereof would not only have been expreſſed by the name of that <hi>one God,</hi> but alſo preſently explained more clearly, when after the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is added, <hi>that he is over all;</hi> for it is ſignified that he only ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth over all with the higheſt Authority, that it may be thence under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that the Father was deſervedly ſo joyned with that One God, as that we ſhould conceive him to be the ſame; as if he had ſaid, <hi>There is one God and Father of all, as who is over all;</hi> for were not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that one God, he could not rule over all with the higheſt autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Now then, had not the force of the word <hi>Lord</hi> been ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed in theſe words?</p>
                     <p>But what force would there be in the word <hi>Spirit?</hi> for it would ſignifie nothing but one ſpiritual Eſſence. Not to ſay, that the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God would not preſently be ſignified, let us even without reaſon ſuppoſe, that a Spirit, or Spiritual Eſſence, being mentioned, the Subſtance of God is by name underſtood? What doth this make to the unity of Chriſtians? is it becauſe they all believe the ſame to be? but neither is the mention of their faith made in this comma; and the unity thereof is peculiarly mentioned, whilſt it is ſaid, <hi>One Faith.</hi> How was it then pertinent to the matter, that there was one ſpiritual, add, if you pleaſe, divine Eſſence? nothing at all: for you muſt underſtand that the Unity of the Faithful, is not thence ſimply concluded, that every one of theſe things which are reckoned up, is one in it ſelf, partly in kind, partly in number, it is common to all the Faithful; for from this Communion of ſuch excellent things, or Unity of things common to Chriſtians, their Unity is concluded: Wherefore all the things which are reckoned up, are either ſuch as exiſt in the very Chriſtians, whether apart, as Hope, Faith, Baptiſm; to which we may alſo refer that one Spirit; or joyntly, as that myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body, or elſe they are things which do indeed exiſt without them, but yet have a manifeſt relation to them, and reduce them to Unity; ſuch as are that <hi>One Lord,</hi> and that <hi>One God,</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> common to them all, <hi>who is over all;</hi> that is, as we ſaid before, who alone ruleth over all with the higheſt Sovereignty, and doth alike guide and govern all; and is alſo <hi>through all;</hi> that is, doth by his providence diffuſe himſelf through all, paſſeth through all the Members of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64944:19"/> Chriſtian Body, and by his goodneſs reacheth unto all, or, which cometh to the ſame purpoſe, is as it were converſant amongſt all, and is in the middle of them, namely, by his help, aid and providence; finally, is in all, that is, dwelleth in all by his Spirit; for they to whom all theſe things are common, ought to be moſt cloſely united amongſt themſelves. But what relation is there between <hi>the Spirit</hi> and Chriſtians, if by that name you underſtand the ſpiritual Eſſence of God; how will that be common to all Chriſtians? for neither is it poſſeſſed by them, as the things of the former ſort, by us reckoned up; likewiſe it hath not a relation unto them, as the word <hi>Lord, God</hi> and <hi>Father;</hi> Doth not the thing it ſelf ſhew, that if you will by this word, underſtand a divine Spirit, you muſt of neceſſity underſtand the holy Spirit, common to all the Faithful, wherewith they are as it were animated and guided? for then he will be in the number of thoſe good things which they by the divine bounty do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; neither indeed ought the mention of him at any hand to be here omitted; partly becauſe the holy Spirit is of eſſential note amongſt the good things common to Chriſtians, which unite them one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in that he erecteth and ſealeth them to the hope of the ſame happineſs. Whence the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the ſame thing to the Chriſtians, after he had ſaid that Chriſt or his Church, is one body as it were compacted of divers members, he addeth,<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13.</note> 
                        <hi>For with one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit we have all been baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bond or free, and we have all been drenched into one Spirit;</hi> for the ſame cauſe he had in the precedent<note n="†" place="margin">

But wher is he to be ſuppoſed to have mentioned it, but when he ſpake of <hi>One Spirit?</hi> unleſs perhaps he would have him comprehended under the name of one Baptiſm; which notwithſtanding they themſelves do not admit, who ſtifly contend that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of Water Baptiſm: nor are we againſt it: and certainly if it be here ſpoken of a divine Spirit, and not of the mind and will, in regard of which the Faithful ought to be one Spirit, there is no doubt but the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the holy Spirit. But if by <hi>one Spirit</hi> you underſtand the holy Spirit, there is no cauſe why you ſhould not by<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6.</note> 
                        <hi>one Lord,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand

                     <p>I ſuppoſe we have ſufficiently ſhewn, that by the name of <hi>Father</hi> in that place to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> is none meant, ſave the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and conſequently none but he, is by <hi>Paul</hi> held to be that one God.</p>

Wherefore it is unſuitable, that the Apoſtle ſhould here confound them, whom elſewhere, treating of the ſame thing, he had ſo open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed; and when, uſing the ſame words, he might bring three diſtinct arguments very fit for his purpoſe, he would rather comprehend but one, drawn from the unity or ſameneſs of the holy Spirit only: Beſides, neither doth the thing it ſelf, nor this place, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64944:21"/> that the holy Spirit ſhould be underſtood, when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that there is the ſame Lord, or the ſame God; for he ſpeaketh not only of ſome moſt high God, or Lord of Chriſtians, by way of excellency ſo called, but of him, beſides whom there is no other; for the meaning of the Apoſtle is not, that ſome moſt high God, or ſome Lord of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, by way of excellency ſo called, is the ſame; but ſimply that, that moſt high God, and Lord, by way of excellency ſo called, is the ſame. But none is Ignorant, that beſides the holy Spirit, the Father is the moſt high God, to whom in innumerable places, the name of God is attributed as proper unto him, as the Adverſaries themſelves confeſs, and is in this very place done, <hi>ver.</hi> 2: where the Spirit is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Spirit of God. Certainly, that the Spirit it ſelf, is not there underſtood by the name of God, appeareth to every one. In like manner that there is alſo, beſides the holy Spirit, a Lord, by way of excellency ſo called, innumerable places of the Scripture ſo teach; wherein, by the confeſſion of the Adverſaries themſelves, the name of Lord is uſed as proper to Chriſt; yea, in this very place, in the ſame ſecond <hi>verſe,</hi> it is affirmed, that Jeſus is <hi>the Lord.</hi> And how often, I pray you, in the Apoſtle is mention made of <hi>God</hi> the Father, and of the <hi>Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt?

                     <head>A further Confirmation and Defence of the Argument.</head>
                     <p>THat we may fully confirm this Argument that is to be proved, whereof we laſt ſpake; namely, That the Father only is that God: between whom and Men the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt is the Mediator.</hi> For that Chriſt is the Mediator between the Father and Men, no man doubteth: but that he is the Mediator only between the Father and Men, many men deny; for they hold that Chriſt is the Mediator of the whole Trinity. But this Opinion cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; for it would thence follow, that Chriſt, who is held the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity, would be the Mediator of himſelf, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veneth in the middle between himſelf, which is contradictious. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Chriſt in this place is moſt openly diſtinguiſhed from God, whoſe Mediator he is ſaid to be. You will ſay, That Chriſt is a Mediator only according to the humane nature, and that there is no abſurdity to hold, that Chriſt conſidered according to the humane Nature, is the Mediator of himſelf conſidered according to the divine Nature, and is righly diſtinguiſhed from that one God. But this anſwer is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not brought, but alſo wholly rejected, by many of the very Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; for others altogether contend, that Chriſt according to both natures is Mediator: but ſome, although they are afraid to ſpeak ſo, yet do they indeed ſay the ſame, for they refer that office to the whole Perſon of Chriſt, conſidered in its full latitude, or to Chriſt as he is both God and Man. As for the reſt, who would have Chriſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the humane Nature only, to be Mediator; neither do they by this diſtinction eſcape the difficulty; for there are or have been ſome, who would have the very humane nature of Chriſt to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Mediator; and contend, that it only is in <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood by the name of the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> O Theſe, as the other Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have obſerved, are neceſſitated to confeſs, that the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt is a Perſon; for both Offices, ſuch as Mediatorſhip is, agree to none but Perſons; and the name of <hi>Man,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> is the name of a Perſon. But if the humane Nature of Chriſt is a Perſon, he cannot be a Perſon of ſupream Deity; for there would be in him two Perſons, a humane and a divine; I ſay, a divine one eſſentially. But that there are two Perſons in Chriſt, all juſtly reject as Neſtorian and contrary to the Scripture, and judged to be moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd.</p>
                     <p>But there are others, and thoſe far more numerous, who to avoid this Rock, deal more ſubtilly; for they ſay, that not the very humane Nature of Chriſt, but his Suppoſitum, or Perſon, is properly the Mediator; whereas the humane Nature, is the formal Principle of that Mediation; namely, that part of the Subject, which containeth in it ſelf the proper cauſe of the action; which becauſe it is ſomewhat obſcure, is to be declared by an example. Philoſophers teach, that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64944:22"/> a man properly doth underſtand, love, and hate, and alſo eat, drink, run, not the very ſoul or the body; but that he doth underſtand, love, and hate according to the ſoul, whereas he doth eat and drink accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the body: So that the formal principle of ſome humane actions is the ſoul, of others the body. In like manner the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries ſay, that the Suppoſitum or Perſon of Chriſt, that is, very whole Chriſt, is properly the Mediator, and conſequently doth ſuch things as pertain to a Mediator, but according to the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and they farther add this reaſon, becauſe, ſhould not the very Perſon of Chriſt be the Mediator, the actions which he performs as Mediator, would not have infinite efficacy and value, nor ſatisfie God for the ſins of men, deſerving infinite puniſhment, which they think to be the proper Office of Chriſt the Mediator. But now becauſe his Perſon, which is the very infinite God, doth properly perform theſe actions, though according to the humane nature, hence it cometh to paſs that they have an infinite force and worth. But whilſt they thus diſpute, they again ſhut the hole to get out at, which they ſeemed to themſelves by the diſtinction of natures to have opened: For if the very divine Perſon of Chriſt is Mediator, and performeth the actions proper to a Mediator, it is neceſſary that the divine Nature alſo ſhould perform the ſame, and ſo Chriſt be a Mediator likewiſe according to the divine Nature: for as the Adverſaries themſelves confeſs, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſon doth not really differ from the divine Nature, nor add any thing to the Nature but a Subſiſtence. But a Subſiſtence hath of it ſelf no powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to act, but all the power to act reſideth in the Nature: the ſubſiſtence is only a condition, without which the Nature doth not act: wherefore whatſoever the divine Perſon of Chriſt doth act, his divine Nature endued with a ſubſiſtence doth act. From whence it may be underſtood, firſt, that it is not rightly ſaid, that the very Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum, as they ſpeak, or Perſon of Chriſt, doth do any thing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the humane Nature, ſince the Perſon of Chriſt, if we follow the force of the Adverſaries Opinion, is the very divine Nature, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its ſubſiſtence. But it is not rightly ſaid, that the divine Nature ſubſiſting, doth do ſomething according to the humane Nature, ſince the humane Nature is not a part of the divine Nature. Whereas the word <hi>according,</hi> as it is uſed by the Adverſaries, includeth the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a part; but if you take that expreſſion, as if it were ſaid, <hi>by the humane Nrture,</hi> then both the Father and holy Spirit might do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing according to the humane Nature of Chriſt, though perhaps the Father not as the neareſt cauſe, and ſuch as immediately moveth the humane Nature, but the holy Spirit dwelling therein, even as the neareſt cauſe, and immediately moving that Nature.</p>
                     <p>Again, it is likewiſe underſtood from what hath been ſpoken, that that diſtinction of Natures cannot cauſe that it may rightly be ſaid, that Chriſt is the Mediator of himſelf, not only becauſe it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous to ſay, that his Perſon doth do any thing according to the humane Nature, if that Perſon be the very ſupream God; but alſo, becauſe from that Opinion of the Adverſaries it would follow, that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64944:22"/> the very divine Nature of Chriſt, doth primarily and properly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Office of a Mediator, although it make uſe of the humane nature in this behalf; for it would be neceſſary, that the ſame divine Nature ſhould intervene in the middle between it ſelf and Men, which every one ſeeth to be abſurd. Finally, it is underſtood, that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Natures cannot cauſe, that Chriſt the Mediator ſhould be diſtinguiſhed from God, if Chriſt be very God himſelf. Add hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that none but thoſe things are ſimply diſtinguiſht one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: of whom it may be ſimply affirmed, that the one of them is not the other. But in this place God and Chriſt, who is ſaid to be his Mediator, are ſimply diſtinguiſhed one from another; wherefore neither is that God Chriſt, nor Chriſt that God; for the diſtinction of Natures cannot cauſe, that any thing ſhould be ſimply denied of ſome ſubject, which for another Nature is to be ſimply affirmed thereof; as we will ſhew more at large Chap. 3. of the following <hi>Section.</hi> Wherefore neither can it cauſe, that any thing ſhould be ſimply di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from that, which is to be ſimply predicated of it, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as ſuch a diſtinction as we have ſeen, doth tacitly involve a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple negation of one in relation to the other.</p>
                     <p>Neither can any one here ſay, that Chriſt in the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, is therefore rightly diſtinguiſhed from God, and ſo tacitly denied that he is that one God, becauſe by the name of <hi>God,</hi> or that <hi>One God,</hi> the whole Trinity is underſtood, whereas Chriſt is not the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: for by this reckoning it might be ſaid, that the Father himſelf is not God, or that one God, becauſe the Father is not the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. But who could endure to hear one ſo ſpeaking? certainly he would openly contradict the Scripture, who durſt to ſpeak in that manner. Beſides, the very Adverſaries themſelves do not ſuppoſe the name <hi>of God,</hi> or that <hi>one God,</hi> to be collective; that is, ſo joyntly ſignifying three Perſons, that it cannot be predicated of each apart: for in predicating, they hold that name hath the nature of an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, ſo that it may be predicated of every Perſon in particular. For inſtance; The Father is that one God, the Son is that one God, the holy Spirit is that one God; wherefore Chriſt was not therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht from that one God, and ſo tacitly denied to be that one God, becauſe he is not the whole Trinity, but becauſe he ſimply is not that one God.</p>
                     <p>Some one will perhaps ſay, as it followeth not, That Chriſt is not a man, becauſe he is the Mediator of men, ſince he is rather therefore a Man, becauſe he is the Mediator of Men: Whence the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaith, <hi>That there is one Mediator of God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> So neither from thence, that Chriſt is ſaid to be the Mediator of <hi>God,</hi> I ſay, the moſt high and only God, doth it follow, that he is not the moſt high and only God. This, though it be more pertinent to the ſecond <hi>Section</hi> of this book, ſhall notwithſtanding receive a brief anſwer; eſpecially, becauſe the thing doth not need any long diſpute: for who ſeeth not, when Chriſt is ſaid to be the Mediator of Men, that by the name of <hi>Men,</hi> other men beſides Chriſt are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,

                     <p>Finally, If the whole Trinity were comprehended under the name of that God whoſe Mediator Chriſt is; he would alſo be the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the holy Spirit. But this is diſentanious to the truth; for there would be open teſtimonies thereof extant in the Tables of the Covenant, whoſe mediator Chriſt was. But what are they? We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not ſuch places of Scripture wherein it is expreſly ſaid, that Chriſt was the mediator of the holy Spirit, but from which it may clearly appear, that Chriſt did ſo intervene in the midſt between the holy Spirit and us, as it is needful that a mediator ſhould intervene between them who are to be joyned in Covenant, and that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the proper part of that Office between him and us. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Opinion, which the moſt learned Adverſaries themſelves think not to be falſe, although they ſay it is imperfect, It is the Office of a mediator between God and men, to be the meſſenger of God to men, and to ſtrike a League between both, and ſo to cauſe, that men being inſtructed with the knowledge of the divine Will, may addreſs themſelves to worſhip God. But the Adverſaries commonly ſuppoſe, that it is the proper Office of Chriſt the Mediator, by fully paying the puniſhment of all our ſins, to appeaſe the wrath of God kindled againſt men, and to intercede for them to God (which we think pertaineth to a Prieſt.) But where is it taught in the Scripture, that Chriſt was the meſſenger of the holy Spirit to men, ſtroke a League between him and men, and brought men indued with the knowledge of his Will to worſhip him?</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64944:25"/> hold, that the holy Spirit did ſend Chriſt otherwiſe than the Lord God, from whom the holy Spirit is openly diſtinguiſhed. But here we ſpeak of ſuch a manner, whereby Chriſt was the Embaſſador or Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of the holy Spirit, as is proper to God. In like manner, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any thing read of a Covenant-ſtroke, between the holy Spirit and men, to omit the other things that might be inſiſted upon. As for the places which the Adverſaries alledge, wherein they think it is written, that Chriſt pacified God toward us: the Adverſaries themſelves are wont to underſtand them of the Father, not of the holy Spirit: concerning whom they produce no teſtimony: neither are they wont to affirm, that Chriſt doth make interceſſion for us to the holy Spirit, but to God the Father: whence<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2.</note> 
                        <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>We have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, who is a Propitiation for our ſins.</hi> It remaineth therefore, that not the whole Trinity, but the Father only be underſtood by the name of <hi>God</hi> in this place of ours; and ſo that one God, and the Father, be accounted for the ſame. But what need many words? the very ſimilitude of this place, with thoſe which we have formerly diſcuſt, wherein by the name of that <hi>One God,</hi> the Father is underſtood, or <hi>that one God,</hi> is ſaid to be the Father, doth ſufficiently teach every one, who will not be obſtinate againſt the truth, that the ſame is here alſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. Furthermore, as in thoſe places, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Paul</hi> would ſhew, that there is the ſame God of all Chriſtians, not one God of theſe, another of thoſe; ſo his purpoſe is here to ſhew, that there is the ſame God of all men, who accordingly is ſo far forth alike affected towards all, as that he would have all ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, and not ſome to be ſaved, and others to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.

                  </argument>
                  <p>THough out of each of thoſe places, wherein after ſuch a manner none but the Father of Jeſus Chriſt is deſigned, we might draw Arguments; yet becauſe the Arguments are alike among themſelves, we will reckon them for one. Thus therefore we may conclude, If by the <hi>Only God,</hi> or the <hi>Only wiſe God,</hi> or the <hi>Only Maſter God,</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only is ſome where underſtood (and we will afterwards ſhew that he is ſo underſtood) it is neceſſary that the Father only be that God, namely, Moſt High, Wiſe, Maſter. For it is neceſſary ſimply to ſay, the <hi>Only God,</hi> or <hi>Only wiſe God,</hi> or <hi>Only Maſter God</hi> is the Father: and contrariwiſe the Father is the <hi>Only God,</hi> or the <hi>Only wiſe God,</hi> or <hi>Only maſter God.</hi> Otherwiſe theſe could not be put for the Father as equivalent; or would not ſignifie the Father only, but ſome other alſo. Take which of thoſe Propoſitions you pleaſe, and our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be eſtabliſhed. If the firſt; it cannot be abſolutely and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſaid, that the only God, or only wiſe, or only maſter God is the Father, if the name of the only God, &amp;c. is of larger extent than the Father, or if any other beſides the Father, is the only God, &amp;c. For neither is a word of a ſtricter ſignification predicated of a large one, but contrariwiſe. If you take the latter Propoſition; it hath bin already ſhewn in the Defence of the firſt Argument, that it is all one as if you ſhould ſay, the Father only is God, the Father only is the wiſe God, or maſter God. For when any one is ſaid to be he to whom only ſomthing doth agree, it is all one as if you ſhould ſay, that the ſame attribute agrees to him only, who is firſt named: as if I ſhould ſay, God is that Spirit, who only exiſted from all Eternity; it is all one as if I ſhould ſay, God only is that Spirit, who exiſted from all Eternity: and ſo in the reſt.</p>

                     <p>NOw that we may ſhew, that the Father only is ſomewhere deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch a manner, we will begin from that place wherein mention is made of <hi>the only wiſe God,</hi> as being very clear and moſt ſuitable to that which is to be proved. And you ſhall find it at the end of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where the Apoſtle ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">Firſt place Rom. <hi>16.27.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>To the only
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64944:26"/> wiſe God through Jeſus Chriſt be honour and glory for ever and ever.</hi> That in this place by the name of the only wiſe God, no other is underſtood but the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, may eaſily be perceived. For it is clear that Chriſt is not underſtood by that name, ſince he is moſt openly diſtinguiſhed, from the only wiſe God, and that as the middle cauſe of glory and honour from the ultimate ſcope and object of the ſame. Nor alſo the whole Trinity held by the Adverſaries. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to Chriſt, who would be contained in that Trinity, glory would be attributed through himſelf, as through the middle cauſe. For as to the refuge of two Natures, that hath no more place here, than in the former Teſtimony: ſince Chriſt is here conſidered with relation to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which he ſuſtaineth, in reſpect whereof he is the middle cauſe of divine Worſhip. Whence the Adverſaries themſelves commonly hold, when we are ſaid to worſhip God through Chriſt, that Chriſt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as Mediator. But Mediation, as alſo other Offices, agreeth to none but a perſon as he is ſuch. Wherefore one muſt either ſay, that the humane Nature of Chriſt is a Perſon, and to be underſtood by the name of Jeſus Chriſt; or hold that Chriſt here is conſidered, according to his divine Nature alſo; or that it is primarily and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here underſtood by the name of Jeſus Chriſt, as hath been ſhewn in the precedent Chapter. It remaineth, that by the name of the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe God, a certain divine Perſon, and that Superior to Chriſt, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. For he is more worthy, to whom glory is given as to the ultimate ſcope, than the middle cauſe, through which worſhip is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to him. But there is no ſuch Perſon beſides the Father. It is in vain here to think of the holy Spirit: for to omit, that it is not gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the holy Spirit is ſo much as a Perſon, this is certain, that the holy Spirit, is not a Perſon worthier than the Perſon of Chriſt: But we have ſhewn that that Perſon is ſuch to whom glory is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through Chriſt. Beſides, that the Father is worſhipped by Chriſt, is both from<note n="*" place="margin">See a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Eph. <hi>5.20.</hi> Col. <hi>3.17:</hi>
                        </note> Scripture, and the confeſſion of all, very manifeſt. But that the holy Spirit is worſhipped by Chriſt, what place of the Scripture, I ſay not doth affirm, but intimate? yea it is ſo far from ſaying that he is to be worſhipped through Chriſt, that it never ſimply ſaith, that glory is to be attributed unto him, eſpecially in that manner which we here underſtand; nor do we there read that it was ever attributed to him by ſo much as one man, concerning which thing more largely in its own<note n="*" place="margin">

Neither indeed is there any cauſe if a certain Perſon is here to be underſtood, why we ſhould paſs by the Father, and underſtand the holy Spirit, ſince glory is here attributed to God as the prime Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Salvation, and of the things belonging thereunto. Now that all thoſe things are wont to be aſcribed to the Father, as the prime Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, if not only, yet chiefly the Adverſaries themſelves do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and is moſt apparent from that place of <hi>Paul,</hi> where he ſaith that the Father is he,<note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi>

                        <hi>Of whom are all things.</hi> Whence alſo he conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him the ultimate end of the worſhip and honour that proceedeth from us; for he is the ſame, <hi>of whom are all things,</hi> and to whom are all things. The ſecond<note n="*" place="margin">The ſecond place John <hi>5.44.</hi>
                        </note> of thoſe places is extant in <hi>John,</hi> where
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64944:27"/> amongſt other things Chriſt ſpeaketh thus unto the Jews, <hi>How can ye believe, who receive Glory from one another, and ſeek not the glory which is from the only God?</hi> In which place that the Father is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the name of the only God; Firſt, the whole context ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth where Chriſt promiſcuouſly mentioneth one while God, another while his Father, neither is there any the leaſt cauſe why we ſhould ſuſpect that Chriſt in the ſame ſpeech paſſed from one perſon to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſince none can deny that all things which are attributed unto that God, are moſt rightly aſcribed to the Father. See now the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent and following verſes, yea that whole conference with the <hi>Jews,</hi> beginning from the 17th verſe. Again, Chriſt ſpeaketh of that God, whom the <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledge for God, and concerning whom it was granted amongſt them, that the Glory proceeding from him is to be ſought, although they neglect to ſeek it. For he ſpeaketh of a thing which ought to precede Faith on Chriſt; whereof becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> were deſtitute, they are therefore here by Chriſt himſelf pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unfit to believe on him. But the <hi>Jews</hi> did then acknowledge for God, no other beſides him, whom Chriſt called his Father. For that they did either imagine a Trinity to be God, or the Son, or holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Spirit, I ſuppoſe there is none that dareth affirm. But Chriſt affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that of his Father, chap. 8.54. where he ſaith, <hi>It is my Father that glorifieth me, whom ye ſay that he is your God.</hi> It is therefore apparent that in this place, that only God is the ſame with the Father, and the one of no larger extent than the other.</p>

                        <hi>Jude,</hi> who if you regard his greek words, ſaith, that falſe Teachers, who had already inſinuated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Church, <hi>do deny the only maſter God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For we have already<note n="*" place="margin">See the Book of God and his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, <hi>chap. 14.</hi>

No marvel, becauſe in the great Houſe of God Chriſt it not the Maſter, but the Son of the Maſter of the Family; and hath God for his Head, as ſhall be ſpoken in its place. But the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Family hath not a Head in the Houſe, but is therein the chiefeſt Lord and Governour. Now whereas ſome urge the Unity of the Article ſet before thoſe words, the only Maſter <hi>God,</hi> and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, they prevail nothing thereby. For the Unity of an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ſet before divers names, doth not preſently argue the Identity of the thing, but often times doth only intimate ſome affinity or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of divers things; as namely of thoſe which concur to the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64944:27"/> ſame action, or about which the ſame action is converſant. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.7. &amp; 16.1. &amp; 6.17. &amp; 1.27. &amp; 27.56. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20. &amp; 3.5. &amp; 4.11. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.19. Certainly<note n="*" place="margin">

It is therefore apparent that Chriſt is not there under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the name of <hi>the only Maſter God.</hi> Moreover, neither can we underſtand by that name the whole Trinity, which is held; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe what need was there, after it had been ſaid that they do deny the whole Trinity, that is the Father, Son, and holy Spirit, to add by name that they do deny our Lord Jeſus Chriſt? As if that had not been ſufficiently ſaid, when it was aſſerted that they deny the whole Trinity. You will ſay that the whole Trinity was but confuſedly, and therefore obſcurely ſignified by the appellation of <hi>the only Maſter God;</hi> therefore ſomething more diſtinct was to be added for explications ſake. We anſwer, if that reaſon had any moment, not only the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but alſo the Father, and holy Spirit, ſhould have been expreſly made, ſince they are no leſs indiſtinctly and confuſedly (if the Opinion of the Adverſaries be true) ſignified by the name of <hi>the only Maſter God,</hi> then Chriſt: To omit, that if Chriſt is dinſtinguiſhed from that only Maſter God, it is agreeable that Perſon ſhould be adjoyned to another perſon, and not when three perſons have been confuſedly taken, one perſon, and that of the number of thoſe three, be ſubjoyned. But if ſome certain Perſon is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, who is there that dares affirm of the holy Spirit (to omit now the queſtion concerning his perſonality) that he, the Father being paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by, is joyned with Chriſt as one that rules, and ſet before him not only in the order of the words, but alſo in dignity of title? For the Scripture in very many places joyneth the Father, as Supream Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch with Chriſt, without making mention of the holy Spirit, and ſet him before Chriſt both in order of words and dignity of title: but never paſſeth by the Father, joyning the holy Spirit, as Lord and Prince, with Chriſt; neither indeed doth it otherwiſe, unleſs it be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeldom, joyn the holy Spirit with Chriſt; ſo far is it from ſetting him before Chriſt in order of words or dignity of title. Not to ſay that the Father is expreſly called Maſter, the holy Spirit no where; much leſs is the holy Spirit deſigned by the name of the only Maſter. Yea, neither is the name of God, any where read to be attributed unto him. Concerning which in its<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </argument>
                  <p>TO the places hitherto alledged, two Viſions are to be added, very like to one another, from whence it is apparent that there is but one perſon of the moſt high God. Which preſently giveth us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rſtand, that the moſt high God is no other beſides the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Since he by the confeſſion of all, is a divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and the others, which are alſo believed to be perſons of ſupream Divinity, cannot be ſo, unleſs he be a divine Perſon: ſince he is the fountain and original of the reſt, and whatſoever Divinity is in them, is derived from him. Wherefore if there is but one Perſon of ſupream Divinity, the Father only is a Perſon having ſupream Divinity. Not to ſay that thoſe very Viſions, which we will quote, do, if they be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with other places of Scripture, ſufficiently intimate, that the God which did in a manner expoſe himſelf to the view, is none but the Father. The firſt of thoſe Viſions is extant in <hi>Daniel,</hi> chap. 7.9, &amp;c. where it is ſaid that the Antient of dayes, that is the God which exiſted from all eternity, did ſit, &amp; that there came to him in the clouds of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as it were a Son of Man, and received of him Authority &amp; Honour, and a Kingdom. The latter is extant, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. and chap. 5. where it is alſo deſcribed, how the Almighty and Eternal God the Creator of all things, ſate upon the Throne; and afterwards a Lamb came to him, and received a book from him, which no other was worthy to open and view, a Book I ſay, of the Sacred Decrees of God concerning things to come. Now in both places, that Moſt High, and Eternal God, which is underſtood by the ſitter upon the Throne, is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as one Perſon, and openly diſtinguiſhed from Chriſt, and that, even then when divine Honour is given of ſaid to be worthy to be given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt. For alſo in <hi>Daniel</hi> it is ſaid, that to him, who came as a Son of man to the Antient of dayes, was by him honour given, and that all People, Tribes, and Tongues, ſhould ſerve him. Where certainly it is not ſpoken of civil honour and ſervice to be performed unto Chriſt, but of religious and divine. And in the<note n="*" place="margin">

But were there many Perſons of the moſt high God, and Chriſt one of them, many alſo would have been exhibited as ſitting upon the Throne; nor would Chriſt
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64944:28"/> have been ſo diſtinguiſhed from him that ſitteth upon the Throne, or from the Eternal and Almighty God, but that it would appear that he likewiſe doth ſit upon the Throne, and is that Eternal and Almighty God.</p>

                     <head>The Defence of the Argument.</head>
                     <p>NOw if any one ſay, that the divine Eſſence only, which is one in number, was repreſented by the Image of him that ſate upon the Throne, and not ſome Perſon; he is exceedingly miſtaken. For beſides the very Image of one ſitting upon a Throne, is indeed the Image of a Perſon, and that one Perſon: the actions which are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to him that ſitteth on the Throne, do altogether demonſtrate that he is an intelligent Suppoſitum; that is, a Perſon. Since actions are commonly ſaid in the Schools to agree unto none but Suppoſitums: But thoſe actions which are attributed to him that ſitteth upon the Throne, are ſuitable to none but an intelligent Nature. Not to ſay that very many Teſtimonies of the Scripture, concerning which we ſhall afterwards<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.</note> have occaſion to ſpeak, being compared with theſe, ſufficiently ſhew that the Father of Jeſus Chriſt is underſtood by him that ſitteth upon the Throne: for they manifeſtly affirm, that he gave to Chriſt Authority, Honour, and a Kingdom, with all other things, without any where hinting that ſome other gave all theſe things to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>As for the diſtinction of Chriſt, and him that ſitteth upon the Throne, no man can juſtly ſay, that Chriſt is according to his humane Nature only diſtinguiſhed from him, being according to the divine Nature the ſame with him. For firſt, according to a better Nature, in regard of which, &amp; which only, he is believed to be a Perſon, were the ſame with him that ſitteth upon the Throne; he could not be ſimply diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him, for that would be all one as if he ſhould ſimply be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be him that ſitteth upon the Throne. But that cannot ſimply be denied of any whole, which for another nature or part is ſimply to be affirmed of the ſame, although it agree not thereunto according to ſome one nature, eſpecially the leſs excellent, as ſhall be underſtood from what we will afterwards ſpeak, <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. How, I pray you, could it come to paſs, that in the whole deſcription of both Viſions, there ſhould not be even the leaſt hint, from whence it might appear, that Chriſt is the ſame with him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and that the diverſities of Natures ſhould be openly expreſſed, but the unity in the knowledge whereof there was no leſs moment, not at all? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſince to Chriſt, as he is diſtinguiſhed from him that ſitteth upon the Throne, actions agreeing to Perſons are attributed, as is manifeſt from the very Viſions themſelves, eſpecially the latter; it is apparent that he is conſidered as a Perſon, and ſo diſtinguiſhed from him that ſitteth upon the Throne. But the Perſon of Chriſt according to the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64944:29"/> Opinion of the Adverſaries, is the ſecond of the Deity; and ſo the very divine Nature it ſelf having its ſubſtance. Wherefore if they will ſpeak agreeable to themſelves, they muſt confeſs that it likewiſe is diſtinguiſhed from him that ſitteth upon the Throne: Or if they will not confeſs this, they muſt with us aſſert, that the Perſon of Chriſt is not the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity, which they hold Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, who would believe, that when divine Honour was aſcribed to Chriſt, he was conſidered only according to his leſs excellent nature, and not rather whole, or according to the Nature moſt worthy of that Honour? but when that Honour is aſcribed unto him, he is moſt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered as diſtinguiſhed from him that ſitteth upon the Throne. Wherefore whole Chriſt, even in reſpect of that other Nature, or a part, which was in him moſt excellent, muſt of neceſſity be diſtinguiſhed from him that ſitteth upon the Throne. Finally, If Chriſt according to a divine Nature, were one and the ſame with him that ſitteth upon the Throne, either more perſons, namely, that of the Father and the Son (not to ſpeak any thing now concerning the holy Spirit) were to be expreſſed as ſitting on the Throne; or it ought to be held, that the Father and the Son are the ſame, not only in Eſſence, but alſo in Perſon.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Tenth Argument may be this, That none but the Father of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is of himſelf, as having received neither his nature, nor any divine thing whatſoever from another, which is the property of the Moſt High God. To which this alſo may be adjoyned, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only is, as they commonly ſpeak, The Fountain of Divinity. For from him the very Son himſelf hath his Divinity, as both the thing it ſelf ſpeaketh, and the Adverſaries alſo commonly confeſs. From the ſame alſo proceedeth the holy Spirit. And though the Latin Churches hold, that the holy Spirit doth proceed both from the Father and the Son; which if rightly underſtood, not only may, but alſo ought to be granted: nevertheleſs it is apparent, partly from the Scripture, partly from the Opinion of the Adverſaries themſelves, that the Son cannot be the firſt Original of the holy Spirit; as we mean when we uſe the word Fountain, but ſuch an original as proceeded from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which was before it. For he who doth himſelf flow from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and from him receive his Divinity, cannot be the prime Source of anothers Divinity. And indeed whatſoever is ſpoken in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and tendeth to ſhew unto us that the holy Spirit doth proceed alſo from the Son, is herein contained, namely, that the Son doth ſend the holy Spirit, and pour him out upon his Confidents. But the Son ſendeth the holy Spirit from the Father, as he himſelf expreſly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>John</hi> 15.26. he alſo ſaid that he would ask the Father, and that he ſhould give them another Advocate, <hi>John</hi> 14.16. and having received the promiſe of the holy Spirit from the Father, he poured out upon the Faithful ſo excellent a gift; as <hi>Peter</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.33. compare alſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.49. &amp; <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.39. Therefore the Greek Churches, though they otherwiſe agree with the Latin concerning the Perſon of the holy Spirit, do yet herein differ from them; namely, that they ſay the holy Spirit proceedeth, or is ſent or given, not from the Father and the Son, but from the Father by the Son: which kind of ſpeaking is more ſuitable to expreſs the true Opinion. It is clear therefore that none but the Father of Jeſus Chriſt, is the Fountain or prime Original of Divinity, and conſequently he only of whom are all things; which is the property of the Moſt High God. For as the moſt high God only is he of whom are all things; ſo he only of whom are all things, is the Moſt High God.

All glory, all happineſs, deſigned either to Chriſt or his confidents, was firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed and provided by the Father. The whole reaſon of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dependeth on him.</p>
                  <p>What ſhould I ſpeak of the Creation of Heaven and Earth? For though the Adverſaries endeavour to vindicate it unto Chriſt and the holy Spirit, yet are they themſelves wont to ſay, that it is wont to be aſcribed unto the Father in a peculiar manner, no otherwiſe than if it were proper unto him; in which manner Redemption is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Son, Sanctification to the holy Spirit, concerning which thing we will ſpeak ſomewhat hereafter, <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. Hence alſo in that which is called the Apoſtles<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Creed,</hi> the Creation of Heaven and Earth is aſcribed neither to Chriſt, nor to the holy Spirit, but to the Father only. For thus we ſay, <hi>I believe in God the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and Earth; and in his only begotten Son,</hi> not confeſſing Chriſt himſelf to be the Creator, but the only begotten Son of the Creator. Neither indeed doth the Scripture any where aſcribe to Chriſt the Creation of Heaven and Earth; and when it attributeth a creation to him, it not only ſpeaketh of a new creation, or certain reformation
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64944:30"/> of things, but alſo no where ſaith that the Son himſelf created all things, but that all things were created by him and in him. Finally, when the Scripture ſpeaketh either of Religion, and the Worſhip of God in groſs, or of certain parts thereof, it is ſo wont to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Father, that it may eaſily appear unto all, that the Father is he, to whom in all ages worſhip was to be given by all men, and was indeed given by all pious men, and to whom only all honour is ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately to be referred. Whence alſo after Chriſt was exalted, yet that cuſtom prevailed in Chriſtian Churches, that publick Prayers ſhould for the moſt part be directed to the Father: ſome few to the Son, but ſeldom or never any (eſpecially if you diſtinguiſh Prayers from Hymns) to the holy Spirit: concerning which thing we will elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 2.</note> ſpeak ſomewhat. Whence the Prayers made in Churches are commonly wont to end in this manner, <hi>Through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> having alſo ſometimes the name of the Son prefixt, through whom namely as a Mediator and Prieſt, prayers are poured out unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himſelf, though we otherwiſe not only willingly confeſs, that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may be poured out to Chriſt himſelf, but contend that they ought often to be poured out; and in our Churches do our ſelves very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently perform the ſame. Notwithſtanding that cuſtom which hath for ſo many ages endured in the whole Chriſtian world, which even that vulgar opinion concerning three Perſons of the moſt high God, hath not been able to take away, giveth teſtimony to our Opinion touching one God the Father. For ſuch a Prerogative of the Father above the Son and holy Spirit, evinceth that he only is the moſt high God. Certainly the very truth it ſelf crept into the minds of men, although they ſet themſelves againſt it, and darted the Beams of her clearneſs into them, not ſuffering her ſelf to be wholly darkned with the clouds of errours. For there appear on every ſide hints and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, from which it is clean that the Father only is he,<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>of whom are all things, and by whom are all things, and for whom are all things,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the moſt high God; that is, by whoſe counſel and decree all things are at firſt conſtituted; by whoſe efficacious providence and vertue all things are perfected; to whom finally, as the ultimate end, all things are referred. A diligent Reader of the Scripture will eaſily obſerve this, eſpecially being thus admoniſhed, if he heed the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of things which are attributed to the Father, Son and holy Spirit, and of the Reaſon for which they are attributed unto them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the forms of ſpeech which are uſed concerning them.</p>

               <p>IN the foregoing Section, we have produced thoſe places, which prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally ſhew, and that directly, that the Father only is the moſt high God; nevertheleſs, they do alſo prove that Chriſt is not that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry God; which we have undertaken to prove in the ſecond place, ſince it pertaineth to the demonſtration of the former. For if Chriſt (and we will afterwards teach that the ſame is to be held concerning the holy Spirit) is not that one moſt high God, it remaineth that the Father only is he, ſince there is no other of whom a Chriſtian can ſo much as ſuſpect that he ſhould be the moſt high God. But we have ſhewn that Chriſt in all thoſe places is diſtinguiſhed from that One God, and therefore cannot be that One God. For the ſame ſhould be diſtinguiſhed from himſelf. And leſt any one ſhould think, that he can here evade by the diſtinction of Natures, we have ſhewn, that in moſt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64944:31"/> places, out of which Judgment may eaſily be made concerning the reſt, Chriſt is there conſidered not according to ſome nature, <label type="milestone">

               <p>But to thoſe Reaſons we think fit to add ſundry more, not that they may not, or ought not of themſelves to be ſufficient for every wiſe and judicious man: but that it may appear with how many and how ſtrong props of the Scripture our Opinion concerning one God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is ſupported.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument the firſt, drawn thence,</hi> That Chriſt is moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed from God.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AS to the Teſtimonies of the firſt ſort, and the Arguments drawn thence, we will begin from thoſe that are largely diffuſed, and may be referred to the names in ſome ſort either denied or attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto Chriſt: of which we will in this place alledge but two. The firſt is, That Chriſt is in innumerable places openly diſtinguiſhed from God ſimply put. And that we may out of ſo great plenty of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, produce a few which may put the Reader in mind of the reſt. How often do we read that Chriſt is called the Son of God? elſewhere we ſee him called the Word or Speech of God, the Image of God: elſewhere we find it written, that he was in the beginning with God, was ſent from God, went out from God, is the Bread of God that deſcended from Heaven, was in the form of God, and equal to God, ſate down at the right hand of God, or of the Power of God, was
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64944:32"/> made Lord and Chriſt by God, was appointed Judge by God. Now it is certain, that by the name of God in ſuch places, the moſt high God is underſtood. How then can Chriſt himſelf be the moſt high God? For it would be neceſſary by this reckoning, either that there are two moſt high Gods, he, namely, who is ſignified by the name of God and Chriſt: and that Chriſt is diſtinguiſhed from himſelf, which all underſtand to be abſurd.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>The Defence of the Argument.</head>
                     <p>BUt to this Argument two things are wont to be given in anſwer. Firſt, That by the name of God in ſuch places, the Father is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted: and that ſince Chriſt is a Perſon different from the Father, there is no marvel that Chriſt is diſtinguiſhed from God. Next that Chriſt in reſpect of the humane Nature is diſtinguiſhed from God, not in reſpect of the divine.</p>
                     <p>The firſt exception for two cauſes chiefly, is of no moment. One is, that it would thence follow, either that there are two moſt high Gods, namely, the Father and Chriſt; or that theſe twain, though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct in perſons, do yet make, one God. The firſt will not be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the very Adverſaries. The latter alſo cannot conſiſt, becauſe the name of <hi>God,</hi> is the name of a Perſon. In as much as it ſignifieth him that exerciſeth Imperial Power over others; and when it is put for the moſt high God, it deſigneth him, who with ſupream Imperial Power governeth all things. But this agreeth to none but a Perſon, or, as the Schools, a Suppoſitum endued with underſtanding, which is the definition of a perſon. Wherefore he that ſaith that there is one moſt high God, ſaith that there is one Perſon with ſupream impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial power ruling all things: and he that ſaith that there are many ſuch perſons, ſaith that there are many moſt high Gods. Of which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ſing, more in the ſecond Book. The other Reaſon is, becauſe if the name of <hi>God</hi> taken for the moſt high God, is common to Chriſt with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there is no cauſe why it ſhould be peculiarly taken for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſo Chriſt be diſtinguiſhed from God. For how ſhall a word common to the Father &amp; the Son, diſtinguiſh the one from the other? ſhould he in their opinion be thought to ſpeak rightly, who ſhould diſtinguiſh the Father from God ſimply put? Who ever, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſake, did read, <hi>the Father of God, the Father ſent God, the Father gave God, God went out from the Father, if ye believe in the Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve alſo in God,</hi> as we read that Chriſt is the Son of God, that God ſent and gave his Son, that Chriſt came out from God; and he himſelf pronounceth, <hi>If ye believe in God, belive alſo in me?</hi> Do not the very ears of men reject thoſe firſt forms of ſpeaking,<note place="margin">

Wherefore we refer the Reader thither.</p>
                     <p>As for the latter exception, which is, That Chriſt according to the humane Nature, not according to the divine, is diſtinguiſhed from God abſolutely put: this alſo cannot conſiſt. For firſt we have already ſhewn<note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Sect.</hi> 1: <hi>Cap.</hi> 6, 8.</note> above, that Chriſt cannot ſimply be diſtinguiſhed from God, if he himſelf be the moſt high God, although according to ſome one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he be not ſo. Again, according to the Opinion of the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, in many of the Places quoted by us, or in ſuch as are like to them, Chriſt is conſidered according to the divine Nature; as when he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Son of God, or the only begotten Son of God; and alſo when he is ſaid to have been in the beginning with God, to have been ſent from God into the world, to have deſcended from Heaven, to have come out from God, to be equal to God. The greateſt part alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer hereunto thoſe expreſſions, that he is called the Image of God, the Word or Speech of God, and that he is ſaid to be in the form of God. Wherefore it is neceſſary to ſay, that in ſuch places, whole Chriſt, how great ſoever he is, is diſtinguiſhed from God, and not in reſpect of one nature only. But from ſuch places, judgment may eaſily be made of the reſt. For why ſhould one ſeek a different reaſon of diſtinction, where it is ſpoken of the ſame perſon, when the ſame perſon may every where have place? Add hereunto, that we will afterwards ſhew that the holy Spirit alſo is in the ſame manner alſo diſtinguiſhed from God ſimply put, as we ſaw Chriſt was diſtinguiſhed from him. But if the diſtinction be the ſame, why not alſo the reaſon of the diſtinction; eſpecially if the ſame may have place in both, as the Adverſaries either confeſs, or are forced to confeſs. For what reaſon of diſtinction they hold in the holy Spirit, the third perſon of the Trinity, as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the ſame muſt they confeſs may alſo be applied unto Chriſt. But if you fly to a diſtinction of natures, there will be a far different rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of diſtinction in both. For this hath no place in the holy Spirit. Wherefore the reaſon of the diſtinction between God and Chriſt, is not to be placed in this, but in ſome other thing. But we have ſhewn that no other can be imagined, than that the Father only be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Moſt High God. And let theſe things ſuffice to have been ſpoken concerning the firſt Argument.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THe ſecond Argument may he fetched from thence, that Chriſt is ſo often in the Scripture called the Son of God. For the Son of God cannot be the moſt high God. To prove which, we will not now repeat that, which we have urged in the foregoing Chapter; namely, that by this very appellation, the Son is diſtinguiſhed from God ſimply ſo called. We will not likewiſe urge, that the ſubſtance of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt of neceſſity be different from that of the Son: ſince every one is really the ſame with his Subſtance or Eſſence: and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Father will be the Son,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1, &amp;c.</note> and the Son the Father. But if there be a different Eſſence of the Son and the Father, the Son cannot be the moſt high God, unleſs you hold two moſt high Gods. We will not finally here urge, that, as the moſt ignorant underſtand, the Son is in time after the Father: whereas the moſt high God cannot be in time after any, ſince he exiſted from all Eternity. Theſe things, I ſay, we will not now urge, in as much as they are elſewhere to be urged; but only this, That from this appellation it followeth, that the Father is more excellent than the Son. But none is in any ſort more excellent than the moſt high God. For whatſoever excellency there is, which is incident to ſupream Divinity, cannot be abſent from him who is the moſt high God. Otherwiſe he would have ſome defect. But ſuch an Excellency it is, to be from ones ſelf. For he is excellenter and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who hath his Eſſence, and whatſoever he hath, from himſelf, than he who hath from another both his Eſſence, and all things that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Eſſence, and cannot be had without it. Now that God the Father hath from himſelf his Eſſence, and all other things which he hath, is granted amongſt all; and had he not, he likewiſe would be the ſon of another, or a creature, not the moſt high God. But the Son for this very reaſon, becauſe he is the Son, hath from the Father his Eſſence, and alſo conſequently whatſoever accompanieth the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and cannot he had without it, which is the cauſe (that we may note this by the way) why Chriſt is in the Scripture far more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>the Son of God,</hi> than <hi>God,</hi> namely, becauſe the former appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation doth ſo expreſs the Divinity of Chriſt, as that it withal diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth the ſame from that moſt high and independent Divinity, which belongeth to the Father; whereas the word <hi>God</hi> doth not do ſo. It is therefore manifeſt, that the Father is more excellent than the Son; and conſequently that the Son cannot be the moſt high God. Certainly even the very Adverſaries themſelves, as we have already<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64944:33"/> the Son and holy Spirit, in that he is the Fountain of Divinity. Whence very many of the antient Doctors of the Church, take that of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 14. <hi>My Father is greater than I,</hi> to be meant of him according to his Divinity, as we ſhall ſee in its place.</p>

                     <head>The Defence of the Argument.</head>
                     <p>BUt there will not be wanting ſome, who will ſay that Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as he is the Son, or in regard of his Perſon, is from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but not as he is God, or in regard of his divine Nature. For that in reſpect hereof, he, no leſs than the Father, is from himſelf, and as they ſpeak, Self-God. Whence it followeth, that a Prerogative and Excellency, doth agree to the Father above the Son, as he is the Son, not as God. But this hinders not, but that Chriſt may be the moſt high God. But this anſwer is of no efficacy. For that very thing which they confeſs, is ſufficient for us to prove that which they confeſs not. For firſt, we have ſhewn, that none can in any ſort be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, than the moſt high God. But they confeſs, and are forced to confeſs, that the Father is more excellent than the Son, as he is the Son, or in regard of his Perſon. Add hereunto, that the moſt high God is in no ſort whatſoever, that is, neither in regard of his nature, nor of his perſon (that we may now in this manner, diſtinguiſh theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Adverſaries) from another. For whatſoever is from another, dependeth on an efficient cauſe. But the moſt high God in no regard dependeth on an efficient cauſe. Wherefore if Chriſt is in regard of his Perſon, diſtinguiſhed from the Father, he cannot be the moſt high God Beſides, it is very ill done of them, ſo to diſtinguiſh the Perſon of Chriſt from his divine Nature, as to ſay, that the one is from the Father, the other not. For a divine Perſon, is nothing but the divine Nature ſubſiſting, as we will ſhew in the ſecond Book, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Adverſaries confeſs. For whereas they, with whom we have now to do, ſay, that a perſon, as ſuch, is nothing but a manner of ſubſiſting, which others call a ſubſiſtence; they are herein won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully miſtaken. And they may learn it even from thence, in that the perſon of the Father doth generate, that of the Son is generated.</p>
                     <p>But a manner of exiſtence, or ſubſiſtence, doth neither generate, nor is by it ſelf generated, but the very nature ſubſiſting. Furthermore, as from other places, ſo chiefly from <hi>John</hi> 10.36, &amp;c. it ſufficiently appeareth, that Chriſt may of right have the name of God given him, as he is the Son of God. For Chriſt there ſheweth that, by the example of them, whom God himſelf heretofore called gods, he, whom the Father had ſanctified, and ſent into the world, may much more be called the Son of God. Where, for the ſame reaſon, he might conclude, that he might much more be called a God, although he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it not, that he might by this means ſhew, that he aſſumed not to himſelf ſupream Divinity, but, as we have elſewhere explained it, do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Certainly, thoſe very perſons alſo whom Chriſt alledged for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were, in that place of the Scripture which Chriſt did in part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for the ſame reaſon called both gods, and ſons of God. This difference only thoſe appellations carry with them, that the former doth not by it ſelf diſtinguiſh thoſe perſons from the moſt high God, whereas the latter doth diſtinguiſh them: the one doth not expreſs the dependency of their Divinity on the ſupream God, although it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the Divinity, which doth depend on the ſupream God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the other doth alſo expreſs that dependency. From whence it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that if Chriſt, as the Son of God, is from the Father, and ſo the Father is more excellent than he, Chriſt alſo as God, is from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo the Father is more excellent than he. Laſt of all, if Chriſt received not his nature from the Father, he was not properly generated. For whoſoever is properly generated by another, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his nature from another. But they, as alſo other Adverſaries, do altogether hold and urge, that the Son was properly generated by the Father, and that otherwiſe he would not be the only begotten Son of God. Wherefore they argue againſt themſelves, whilſt they deny that Chriſt received his divine Nature from the Father, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that he hath his Perſon only from him. Though even in that they are not alwayes very conſtant to themſelves, as hath been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by other Adverſaries.</p>

Wherefore we will

For indeed his drift was, to ſhew the Divinity of Chriſt, but ſuch a one, as is wholly dependant on God. <hi>For theſe things,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are written that you may believe, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God,</hi>

From this place we thus argue, The moſt high God can do all things of himſelf, Chriſt can do nothing of himſelf; therefore Chriſt is not the moſt high God. The major Propoſition, as they call it in the Schools, is by it ſelf manifeſt. For the moſt high God is the firſt and ſupream Cauſe of all things; and conſequently whatſoever he doth, he doth it of himſelf, not from another, otherwiſe he would not be the firſt and ſupream Cauſe; but the Perſon rather from whom he had a faculty or power to do ſomething.

                     <head>The Defence of the Argument.</head>
                     <p>TO this Argument a double anſwer is wont to be brought, neither whereof is indeed altogether direct; ſince one maketh a ſhew of weakning the Major; the other by either diſtinguiſhing or limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Premiſes, endeavoureth to make the whole Argument inval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid. For ſome anſwer, that Chriſt therefore ſaith, he can do nothing of himſelf, becauſe he hath not the power of working from himſelf, but receiveth it from the Father, by the eternal generation out of his Eſſence; and therefore they confeſs that Chriſt here ſpeaketh of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf according to his Divinity, and conſequently as he is the moſt high God: and they accordingly deny, that there is any repugnancy for one to be the moſt high God, and to do all things not of himſelf, but by a power received from another. Others anſwer, that Chriſt here ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of himſelf according to his humane Nature, not according to his divine. So that from this Argument no other thing will follow, than that Chriſt according to his humane Nature, is not the moſt high God; which themſelves willingly confeſs.</p>
                     <p>As to the former anſwer, that cannot conſiſt, for two cauſes chiefly. The firſt is, in that it doth ſundry wayes involve a contradiction, For firſt, it maketh the ſame perſon both to be the moſt high God, and not the moſt high God, the moſt high God expreſly, not the moſt high God, in that it affirmeth him to do all things by a power received from another. For whilſt it holdeth ſo, it denieth him to be the firſt cauſe of all things, and ſo to be the moſt high God, as appeareth from what was ſaid before. Again, whilſt it ſaith that Chriſt was generated from all Eternity, it together ſaith, both that he is Eternal, and not Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; Eternal expreſly, not Eternal tacitly, whilſt it affirmeth him to be generated. Beſides, whilſt he ſaith that he was indeed generated out of the Eſſence of the Father, but ſo, that he hath the ſame nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Eſſence; yet ſaith that the ſame Chriſt is generated of himſelf. Since every one, as we hinted before, is the ſame with his Eſſence, and the Adverſaries confeſs, that the divine Perſons are really the ſame with the Eſſence, although they would have them really to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer amongſt themſelves. The ſecond cauſe, for which the former an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer cannot conſiſt, is that ſuch an explication of the words of Chriſt, is repugnant to the Text, and thirdly to the words of the following verſe, wherein Chriſt being about to explain the reaſon of his ſaying, ſpeaketh thus,<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ver.</hi> 20</note> 
                        <hi>For the Father loveth the Son, and ſheweth him all things which himſelf doth; and will ſhew him greater works than theſe, that you marvel.</hi> Now that the whole buſineſs may be the plainer, ſome things are here beforehand to be obſerved. Firſt, theſe twain as we have already hinted, are oppoſed, <hi>ſo to do ſomething of himſelf, and ſo to do ſomething if he ſee the Father doing it;</hi> and Chriſt doth therefore deny the firſt of himſelf, becauſe he affirmeth the latter of himſelf. Again,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64944:35" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                        <hi>ſo to do ſomewhat of ones ſelf,</hi> is to work by a power, wiſdom and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his own, and not received from another. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that to do ſomething, if he ſee the Father <hi>do it,</hi> is to do it not by a power, wiſdom and authority of his own, but ſuch as was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Father. For Chriſt in this place compareth the Father to an Artiſt, which by his own example inſtructeth his Son, and moſt faithfully ſheweth him what is to be done, and by that means cauſeth that he likewiſe may do the ſame: but himſelf he likeneth to ſuch a Son, that beholdeth the things ſhewn unto him by the Father, and learneth, and imitateth them; namely, becauſe he received from him that power, wiſdom and authority whereof we have ſpoken. By giving this therefore, the Father doth ſhew, by receiving the ſame the Son doth ſee. Whence we argue thus; if Chriſt did therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that he can to do any thing of himſelf, becauſe he received from the Father by eternal generation, a Power of doing all things; it would follow that the Father had by that generation ſhewn him all things. But that this is falſe, appeareth ſundry wayes: firſt, becauſe it would follow from thence, that all things had been abſolutely, without the exception of any thing, been already ſhewn to Chriſt from eternity, and that nothing more, much leſs ſomething greater, could be further ſhewn unto him, by that eternal Generation, out of the Eſſence of God. The Son had received the Eſſence of God himſelf, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently alſo his Omnipotency, together with all his natural Properties, as indeed the Adverſaries do believe. But to him that hath theſe, nothing farther can be ſhewn, or a power of doing nothing, can any farther be given to him no more than to the Father himſelf.<note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>ver:</hi> 20</note> But Chriſt, as we ſee manifeſtly, affirmeth, that the Father would yet ſhew unto him greater things than theſe which he had already ſhewn; that is, give him a faculty of performing greater works.

But Chriſt afterward affirmeth, that theſe were therefore, that is, ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be given unto him, becauſe he is the Son of Man, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. from whence it would follow, that greater works were by the Father ſhewn to Chriſt, becauſe he is the Son of Man, than by that eternal Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the Eſſence of God, which maketh him to be the moſt high God; which overthroweth it ſelf. Beſides, if the Father by eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Generation out of his own Eſſence, had given that faculty of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Son, he would not have given it of his own free will, but of neceſſity. For that generation is by the Adverſaries held to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether neceſſary, and conſequently all things that are neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein, or neceſſarily conjoyned therewith. And indeed it is neceſſary they ſhould ſo hold, otherwiſe that generation would not be eternal. For whatſoever is ſimply from eternity, is alſo ſimply neceſſary.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64944:36"/> eternal, becauſe the free act of his will, doth in time precede it. Now Chriſt himſelf in the words, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. alledged by us, ſheweth that the Father did of his own free will, not by neceſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For he ſaith, <hi>The Father loveth the Son, and ſheweth him all things which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth;</hi> as if you ſhould ſay, and therefore, namely, becauſe he loveth the Son, he ſheweth him all things which himſelf doth: as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one doth by himſelf perceive. But whatſoever God doth out of his love towards any one, he doth it of his own free will; what he doth out of neceſſity, ſo that he cannot but do it, he doth not out of love. Finally, when the Father is ſaid to ſhew all things unto the Son, and that out of his love towards him, it is apparent that the Son alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy exiſted when he ſhewed him, and that he is looked upon as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begotten, and not as one who is in that very act begotten. But in that generation Chriſt is not conſidered as already begotten (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he would not be begotten) but as one who is in that very act produced.

To the intent therefore that we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch what we firſt propoſed, of thoſe places in which the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries commonly think, that they have an example of their deſtinction, the firſt is extant <hi>Acts</hi> 2.30. where <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that God ſwore to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> that he would raiſe up Chriſt <hi>out of the fruit of his loins according to the fleſh.</hi> The ſecond place is extant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3. where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the Son of God <hi>was made of the Seed of David according to the fleſh.</hi> The third is in chap. 9. of the ſame Epiſtle, where it is ſaid, that Chriſt was according to the fleſh of the Fathers.

Thus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.18. he commandeth to view <hi>Iſrael according to the fleſh,</hi> likewiſe oppoſing it to <hi>Iſrael according to</hi> the Spirit; that is, the Chriſtian People; for the People of Chriſt is the true and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. thus, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. he ſaith, that he henceforth knoweth (that is, eſteemed and approved) none <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh;</hi> and if he hath at any time known Chriſt <hi>according to the fleſh,</hi> he now no longer knoweth him: where likewiſe <hi>according to the fleſh,</hi> is tacitly oppoſed to that which is according to the ſpirit, and is to be looked upon either in Chriſt, or in them who are in Chriſt. Likewiſe that place is very notable, which is extant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. where one ſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> namely, <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> is ſaid to be born <hi>according to the fleſh,</hi> ver. 23, 29. but the other, namely, <hi>Iſaac, according to the ſpirit,</hi> ver. 20. whereby is meant not according to the divine Nature, but by the divine Power: which for the divine Promiſes given before, did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene to accompliſh his nativity, compare ver. 23, 28. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8, 9. although the ſame <hi>Iſaac,</hi> if his generation be compared with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual generation of the Chriſtians, not with the birth of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> it may be ſaid of right, to be made according to the fleſh.

And leſt there ſhould be any place for an evaſion, that very place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3. which the Adverſaries think make for them, doth confirm our Opinion. For thus ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Who was made of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64944:37"/> the Seed of</hi> David <hi>according to the fleſh, who was declared</hi> (Gr. defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or conſtituted) <hi>Son of God in power according to the Spirit of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the reſurrection from the dead.</hi> You ſee that theſe words, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh,</hi> are oppoſed to thoſe <hi>according to the Spirit of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> that is, the Spirit wherewith Chriſt was ſanctified, and that the diſcourſe is concerning the matter, whereof Chriſt was made the Son of God by the reſurrection from the dead. Concerning which, we will ſpeak more hereafter, chap. 31. <hi>but according to the Spirit,</hi> doth no where ſignifie according to the divine Nature; neither doth the word <hi>Spirit,</hi> put ſubjectively either alone, or with ſome addition, any where denote the divine Nature or Eſſence. And the very word <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in this place applied unto it, may ſufficiently intimate to every one, that it is not here ſpoken concerning the holy Spirit, the divine Vertue, whereby Chriſt was raiſed from the dead, and appointed hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly King of the People of God, and conſequently made the Son of God by way of excellency. For we ſhall ſee hereafter, chap. 31. that, oftentimes in the Scripture, to be Chriſt, or the King anointed by God, is all one with being the Son of God; from whence alſo may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, another paſſage in the ſame Epiſtle, chap. 9.5. For in what manner Chriſt is the Son of God, in the moſt perfect manner ſo called, in the ſame alſo is he <hi>a God over all to be bleſſed for evermore.</hi> But he was <hi>made or conſtituted the Son of God in power by the reſurrection from the dead;</hi> wherefore a God over all to be bleſſed for ever more. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thoſe words <hi>according to the fleſh,</hi> annexed to the precedent ones, ſeem to require that the other members of diſtinction, ſhould in the following member<note n="*" place="margin">Or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</note> be underſtood, it is no hard thing to diſcern, that what we would have, is rather to be underſtood, than what was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Adverſaries Opinion to be ſupplied. For theſe words, according to the divine Nature, would be childiſhly underſtood. For this the Apoſtle muſt be imagined to ſpeak, <hi>Who according to the divine Nature, is God over all bleſſed for evermore.</hi> But when you have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the divine Nature or Eſſence, you have indeed already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned that which is annexed But the abſurdity ceaſeth if you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that which we ſay the Apoſtle expreſſeth, chap. 1. of the ſame Epiſtle; namely, <hi>according to the Spirit of Holineſs.</hi> I omit that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Peter</hi> in that whole Sermon of his, wherein he affirmeth that God ſwore to <hi>David,</hi> that he would from the fruit of his loins, raiſe up Chriſt <hi>according to the fleſh,</hi> that argueth a divine Eſſence in Chriſt, but the reſurrection and exaltation of Chriſt wrought by divine Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, whereby he became the Son of God in the moſt perfect manner, as we have already ſeen in part, and will more fully ſhew in its place; wherefore there is nothing in thoſe places, that may eſtabliſh the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Adverſaries. But if there be nothing in them that may eſtabliſh it, although among others they ſeem moſt of all to confirm it, it may of right be concluded, that neither is there any elſe in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that may eſtabliſh it, and conſequently that it ſhould not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to reſtrain ſo many places of the Scripture, ſpeaking ſimply, and uſed to turn them from their plain meaning. But now we muſt come
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64944:37"/> to that which we have undertaken to prove in the ſecond place, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this diſtinction is of no moment to invalide our Argument drawn from that place, <hi>John</hi> 5.19. or others like thereunto.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, the cuſtom of ſpeaking, doth not admit that what may or ought ſimply to be admitted of any whole ſhould ſimply be denied of the ſame, although it agreeth to the whole, according to one part only, and not according to the other. For who for example ſake, will ſimply deny, that a man doth eat, drink, or is fleſhly, thick, tall, or of a low ſtature, becauſe his ſoul, or he according to his ſoul, doth not eat, drink, nor is fleſhly, thick, tall, or on the contrary of a ſhort ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Although the ſoul be the better part of a man, and thoſe things agree to him only according to the body. But if Chriſt be the moſt high God, it is to be ſimply affirmed of him, that he can do all things of himſelf; as was before ſhewn: neither do the Adverſaries, who ſay, that theſe words of Chriſt whereof we treat, are to be underſtood of him according to the humane nature only, not deny, but rather urge it. For neither are they wont leſs ſimply to affirm of Chriſt, what agreeth unto him, according to his better Nature, than to deny what agreeth not to him, according to his inferiour Nature. Wherefore if Chriſt were the moſt high God, it could not be ſimply or without any limitation, and reſpect of a certain nature, expreſly added, be denied of him that he can do any thing of himſelf. Since therefore it is denied, it is apparent that he is not the moſt high God. Add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that Chriſt in this place is deſcribed by the name of the Son of God and that in reſpect of God. But moſt of the Adverſaries refer this deſcription only to the divine Nature of Chriſt, all refer it to it chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Wherefore ſo much the leſs credit is it, that that is here ſimply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied of him which agreeth to him according to the divine Nature, and conſequently both may and ought to be ſimply affirmed of the Son of God. Certainly that would be all one as if you ſhould ſay, that a man or a ſubſtance endued with underſtanding, cannot underſtand, reaſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, becauſe he cannot do theſe things according to the body.</p>
                     <p>But againſt that which we have ſaid, ſome of the Adverſaries are wont to alledge, that a man according to his ſoul is immortal, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, and yet it is ſimply denied, that he is immortal or incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible. But it is to be obſerved that we ſpeak of thoſe Attributes, which both may and are wont to be affirmed of the whole Subject ſimply and without limitation, although they do primarily and by themſelves only agree to one part thereof, ſo to the whole only by conſequence. But to be immortal or incorruptible, as the very Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries together with us confeſs, is not ſimply and without limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on affirmed of the whole man; namely, becauſe we ſee the whol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> compoſition of man to be diſſolved, and to die, and be corrupted, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Spirit remain after it. But the ſame Adverſaries contend, that as all the attributes which agree to the Humanity of Chriſt, are wont ſimply &amp; without limitation to be affirmed of Chriſt, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſake, that he was conceived, born of a Virgin, ſuffered, dyed, was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, raiſed up from the dead, &amp; the like, ſo alſo all the attributes of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64944:38"/> divine Nature. Wherefore as they ſimply affirm that he is God, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they ſimply and without limitation affirm, and if they will be true to themſelves, are forced to affirm, that he exiſted from all Eternity, Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, Omniſcient, Immenſe, Creator of Heaven and Earth. Some alledge that of<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17.</note> 
                        <hi>Paul,</hi> where he affirmeth, that the evils which he worketh, he himſelf did not work, but ſin that dwelleth in him; where they think, that what is ſimply affirmed of the whole, is ſimply denied of the ſame, becauſe it agreeth not to the other part. And therefore that the contradiction which at firſt ſight appeareth in theſe words, is to be taken away by the diſtinction of parts. But they are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly miſtaken, for neither hath <hi>Paul</hi> reſpect to divers parts in the ſame ſubject, as if the thing were attributed to the ſubject according to one part, and according to the other part taken away from the ſame, this, I ſay, is not there done: but the ſame attribute is by an elegant <hi>Antanaclaſis,</hi> one while taken more largely, another while more ſtrictly, namely, by a certain excellency; and being taken more largely, is attributed to the Subject; but taken more ſtrictly, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied of the ſame whole, and not attributed to another part of the ſame Subject, but to another Subject, as the place it ſelf ſheweth. For the man deſcribed by <hi>Paul</hi> under his own perſon, is ſaid to work theſe evils, the word <hi>work</hi> being taken properly and largely: but the ſame is denied to work them, as the word <hi>work</hi> ſignifieth, to be the prime and principal cauſe of working. For this, he ſaith, is not he himſelf, but ſin. In the ſame manner he elſewhere ſaith, that he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more than the other<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10.</note> Apoſtles, yet not he, but the Grace of God that was with him. He affirmeth, that he himſelf laboured, if it be properly ſpoken; but denieth the ſame, becauſe he was not the prime and principal cauſe of the labour; but the grace of God that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with him. Thus alſo Chriſt<note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>John</hi> 7.6.</note> ſaith, <hi>My Doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me.</hi>

                        <hi>He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that ſent me.</hi> For the Doctrine of Chriſt was his own, becauſe it was promulgated by him; it was not his own, becauſe himſelf was not the prime Author thereof, but he that ſent him. It is believed on him, becauſe he is the object of faith, not on him becauſe he is not the principal object and ultimate ſcope of faith; for ſo he is that ſent Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore that we may return unto our place, it is neceſſary that Chriſt when he ſimply denied, that he could do nothing of himſelf, did ſpeak of himſelf wholly, how great ſoever he is, and not only of one part of himſelf, or not of himſelf according to one part only. Which that it may yet more evidently appear, and the rule before ſet down by us, be the more confirmed, this is to be added; If that which may, is wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> abſolutely to be affirmed of the whole, may alſo ſimply and abſolutely, without any limitation, be denied of the ſame whole; namely, becauſe it agreeth not thereunto according to ſome part, though an inferiour one, it will be lawful ſimply to affirm of Chriſt, what we would have; namely, that he is not the moſt high God, did not exiſt from Eternity, did not create the World, that the Son of God
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64944:38"/> was not incarnate, or made man, was not in Heaven before he was born of the Virgin: becauſe none of theſe things agree to him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the humane Nature: yea, it may be ſaid, that the Son of God, is not the Son of God, eſpecially the only begotten one, if he is held to be ſuch, as he was begotten out of the Eſſence of the Father, which agrees not to him according to the humane Nature. Finally, it will be lawful to ſay, that he was neither conceived of the holy Spirit, nor born of <hi>Mary,</hi> nor grew, nor eat, nor drank, nor wept, nor dyed, nor roſe again, nor aſcended into Heaven, nor ſhall come to judgment, and other things innumerable, becauſe none of theſe things agreeth to him according to the divine Nature. Thoſe firſt Expreſſions the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries will not endure; as for the reſt, the ears of no Chriſtian man can endure them. Who would endure ſuch a Divinity, as permitteth one ſimply to deny, that Jeſus is the Son of God, or that he ſometimes dyed and roſe again. Wherefore if thoſe things are both<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, or incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> uncouth, and intollerable, they ought alſo to imagine, that their interpretation is alike intollerable; whereby they ſay, that when Chriſt ſimply ſaith, the Son can do nothing of himſelf, he ſpeaketh of himſelf according to the humane Nature only; whereas according to the divine Nature, he can do all things of himſelf; whence it followeth, that it may be abſolutely ſaid of him, that he can do all things of himſelf, no leſs than he is abſolutely affirmed to be the moſt high God.</p>
                     <p>Again, They with whom we have to do, do either confeſs, that it may be ſimply, or without any limitation added, ſaid of the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt, that it can do nothing of it ſelf, or they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs. If they do confeſs, why do they diſtinguiſh between the humane and divine Nature? Why do they ſay, that the words of Chriſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we treat, are not to be underſtood of him according to the divine, but according to the humane Nature? Will they perhaps ſay, that alſo the divine Nature can do nothing of it ſelf according to the humane? Who ſeeth not that ſuch a faſhion of ſpeaking and limiting is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous? Will you ſay that the ſoul of a man hath not in it ſelf according to the body, a power of thinking, underſtanding, reaſoning? Or that the body is not fleſhly, thick, tall, or low according to the ſoul? But be it that it is lawful, having expreſly added ſuch a limitation, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny theſe things of the ſoul as doth indeed agree unto it, but do not agree unto the body; and contrarily of the body, ſuch as agree to it, but do not agree to the ſoul, will it be preſently lawful to do the ſame ſimply, and without any limitation? Who ever heard ſay, that that ſhould ſimply be taken away from the whole which doth indeed agree thereunto, becauſe it agreeth not to the other part of the ſame whole? How then could that be ſimply taken away from the divine Nature, which doth agree to the ſame; namely, to do all things of it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it agreeth not to the humane Nature? But if the Adverſaries confeſs not, that it may ſimply be ſaid of the divine Nature of Chriſt, that it can do nothing of it ſelf, their Opinion touching the Perſon of Chriſt falls to the ground; for if the Son of God is a Perſon having ſupream Divinity, it is neceſſary that whatſoever is ſimply either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64944:39"/> or affirmed of him, may alſo ſimply be either denied or affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his divine Nature. For a perſon having ſupream Deity, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the very divine Nature ſubſiſting; as many of the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries confeſs; and we in the ſecond Book will ſhew.<note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.</note> Since therefore it is ſimply denied of the Son of God, that he can do nothing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whereas that ſame cannot be ſimply denied of the divine Nature, it muſt be confeſſed, that the Son of God is not a Perſon of ſupream Deity. Neither can they eſcape the force of this Argument, who hold a divine Perſon to be not the divine Nature, but a ſubſiſtence of the divine Nature. For firſt, from this very place of <hi>John,</hi> it is evinced either that their Opinion touching a divine Perſon, is falſe, or that the Son of God is not a Perſon endued with Supream Divinity. For a Subſiſtence worketh nothing neither of it ſelf, nor by the ſhewing of another. For the very nature ſubſiſting, worketh all things, either by a faculty of its own, or ſuch as was received from another. A Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence hath no faculty neither from its ſelf, nor received from another. But the Son of God worketh all things by the ſhewing of the Father. Wherefore he is not a Subſiſtence. If the Son of God is not a ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, either a Perſon of the ſupream Divinity will not be a Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, or the Son of God will not be a Perſon of ſupream Divinity. Furthermore, if a Subſiſtence did work any thing, it would work in ſuch a manner, as is agreeable to the Nature wherein it is, and with which it is really the ſame. But the divine Nature, wherein the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Subſiſtence is, and with which, as the Adverſaries ſpeak, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the ſame, worketh of it ſelf, and not by the ſhewing of another; wherefore the divine Subſiſtence alſo ſhould be ſaid to work after that manner; nor could it leſs ſimply be denied, that it can work of it ſelf, than the ſame may be denied of the divine Nature. Add hereunto, that it would no leſs ridiculouſly be ſaid, that the divine Subſiſtence can do nothing of it ſelf according to the humane Nature, than that the divine Nature can do nothing of it ſelf acccording to the humane Nature.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, were the words of Chriſt to be reſtrained, as the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries would have it, Chriſt had not ſpoken to the matter. For it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth from the very place, and all confeſs, that Chriſt anſwereth the objection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and defineth thoſe words of his, namely, <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and I work,</hi> from all crime of Blaſphemy and Arrogancy. For the <hi>Jews</hi> objected it to him as a moſt grievous crime, becauſe by ſuch words, <hi>he calleth God his own Father, making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf equal to God,</hi> as we read ver. 18. For thus they reaſon; He that maketh himſelf equal to God, committeth a crime to be expiated by death. But Chriſt maketh himſelf equal to God, in that he calleth God his own Father, and maketh himſelf equal to him in working. In which Argument it is ſpoken of whole Chriſt, and not only of one Nature of his, eſpecially the leſs worthy. For neither Chriſt when he affirmed, <hi>My Father worketh, and I work,</hi> ſpake only one part of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that the leſs worthy, but of himſelf as he was the Son of God, and conſequently God, as the Adverſaries themſelves urge, who are
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64944:39"/> wont to object againſt us thoſe words of the 18th verſe; to prove from thence, that Chriſt is God by Nature, becauſe he both called God his own Father, and made himſelf equal to God: neither of which can agree to him, who is not God by Nature. To which Argument of the <hi>Jews</hi> Chriſt anſwereth, <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, the Son can do nothing of himſelf.</hi> What would the anſwer make to the purpoſe, if Chriſt ſhould here ſpeak of himſelf, according to the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture only; when the queſtion was concerning him, either whole, how great ſo ever he is, or according to the divine Nature, as the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries will have it? How had he defended his own words, wherein he had ſpoken of his whole ſelf, or of himſelf, as the moſt high God? It is objected againſt him, thou makeſt thy ſelf equal to God; namely, in that thou makeſt thy ſelf the Son of God, and by that means doſt (as the Adverſaries will have it) arrogate to thy ſelf a divine Nature. Chriſt anſwers (according to their Opinion) the Son can do nothing of himſelf according to the humane Nature, and is therein unequal to the Father. What's this to the matter? But if you hold with us, that Chriſt ſpake of himſelf whole, how great ſoever he was, you will find that he ſpake very pertinently to the matter, and ſolidly confuted the crime that was objected againſt him. For he anſwers, that he doth not ſimply and abſolutely make himſelf equal to God, although in reſpect of working, he compareth himſelf unto God: becauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he doth all things that the Father doth; yet can he do nothing of himſelf, but thoſe things only which the Father gave him a power to do. wherefore in reſpect of the working it ſelf, he is equal to the Father; in reſpect of the manner of working, unequal. For the Father worketh of himſelf, but he only as the Father ſheweth him, or giveth him power, wiſdom and authority. But herein is no Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, no Arrogancy, no Crime. Add hereunto, that that very equality which is ſeen in the very workers, conſidered by themſelves, is not altogether abſolute. In that the Father will yet ſhew him grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter works, and conſequently ſomething may be yet added to that equality.</p>
                     <p>Finally, If Chriſt had ſpoken of himſelf in reſpect of the humane Nature only, when he ſaid that he could do nothing of himſelf, and in the mean time would have had it underſtood, that he in reſpect of the divine Nature, could do all things of himſelf, he had not, or rather ought not to have oppoſed the Father, eſpecially alone to himſelf in that matter, but himſelf conſidered according to the divine Nature, to himſelf look'd upon according to the humane. But Chriſt doth not this, but the other, whilſt he ſubjon'd, <hi>unleſs he ſee the Father doing.</hi> Alſo, <hi>For the Father loveth the Son, and ſheweth to him all things whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>h himſelf doth;</hi> and will ſhew him greater works than theſe. For beſides that, the reaſon of the oppoſition doth more rightly conſiſt, if one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt be oppoſed to another Nature; that is, of a different diſpoſition in relation to the thing ſpoken of, than if the ſame ſhould be oppoſed to another perſon; no juſt cauſe can be imagined, why Chriſt, when in reſpect of one nature, he had denied that the Son could
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64944:40"/> do any thing of himſelf, ſhould not in reſpect of the other nature, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm of the ſame Son, that he could do all things of himſelf, ſince there was no greater cauſe to deny that, than to affirm this. That I may not ſay, that there was greater cauſe to affirm this, than to deny that; ſince the queſtion was concerning the equality of the Son, and that as he is the Son, with the Father. Add hereunto, that the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt would have been the more near and proper Cauſe of that faculty of doing Miracles, which he had received according to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, than the Father. Unleſs perhaps you will have the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature in him to be idle. Wherefore the power was to be aſcribed to it rather than to the Father. Now whereas ſome affirm that Chriſt attributed his works rather to the Father, than to his own divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he might give to the Father a Prerogative above himſelf; this very thing overthroweth their Opinion, and eſtabliſheth ours; eſpecially ſince it is neceſſary, that that Prerogative ſhould conſiſt in this, namely, that the Father be held to do all things of himſelf, the Son only by a power received, from the Father. For by this very thing, Chriſt is denied to be the moſt high God, whilſt another is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to whom a Prerogative above him doth agree; and whilſt it is affirmed that he doth all things by a power, in what manner ſoever received from another. On the contrary, the Father is alone held, to be the moſt high God, whilſt to him only, as the prime Cauſe, the works of Chriſt are aſcribed, and a Prerogative attributed to him above Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>That now remaineth which we undertook to demonſtrate in the third place, namely, that the very Diſtinction which the Adverſaries uſe, whilſt they ſay that ſome things agree or not agree to Chriſt, or the Son of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to the divine, others according to the humane Nature, doth overthrow their Opinion concerning Chriſt. For from this very thing it followes, that the Son of God is not a perſon of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Divinity, the reaſon whereof we have ſomewhere already toucht. For whilſt the Adverſaries thus diſtinguiſh, they ſhew that the humane Nature is a part of the perſon of Chriſt, and pertaineth to the conſtitution thereof. But a humane Nature cannot be a part of a perſon endued with ſupream Divinity, nor concur to the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof. For whether you hold the divine perſon to be the divine Nature endued with a ſubſiſtence, or the very ſubſiſtence it ſelf of the divine Nature; the humane Nature can neither way be a part thereof. For neither is it a part of the divine Nature, nor of a ſubſiſtence, ſince neither is conſtituted of divers parts, and both exiſted entire from all Eternity, and conſequently a humane Nature can conſtitute neither. Certainly it is neceſſary to hold two perſons in Chriſt, one ſimple, which exiſted from all Eternity; the other compounded of a humane and divine Nature (though by this means a divine perſon would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come part of another, &amp; ſo ceaſe to be a perſon) or they muſt bid fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel to that diſtinction of Nature.

                  </argument>
                  <p>NOw that we may proceed to other places in <hi>John,</hi> wherein ſome thing is denyed of Chriſt, which could not be denyed of him if he were the moſt high God; to that paſſage which we have examined in the precedent Chapter, thoſe are of kin wherein Chriſt denies that he is the prime Author of that Doctrine which he publiſheth; which places are in great number; and in ſome of them mention is made alſo of works; of which he maketh the prime Author, not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but the Father, no leſs than in the precedent teſtimony. For, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.16, 17, 18. when the <hi>Jews</hi> admired how he knew letters, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not learnt them: Jeſus anſwered them, and ſaid, <hi>My Doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me. If any one will do his Will, he ſhall know of the Doctrine, whether it be from God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf. He that ſpeaketh of himſelf, ſeeketh his own glory: but whoſoever ſeeks his Glory that ſent him, he is true, and there is no unrighteouſneſs in him.</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.28 <hi>When ye ſhall have lifted up the Son of Man, then ſhall ye know that I am he, and do nothing of my ſelf, but as the Father hath taught me I ſpeak theſe things.</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 12.49, 50. <hi>I have not ſpoken of my ſelf, but the Father that ſent me, he gave me a Commandment, what I ſhould ſay, and what I ſhould ſpeak, and I know that his Commandment is eternal Life. What things therefore I ſpeak, as the Father hath ſaid unto me, ſo I ſpeak.</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 14.10. <hi>The Word that I ſpeak, I ſpeak, not of my ſelf; but the Father that abideth in me, he doth the works.</hi> Where under the name of <hi>works,</hi> his words alſo are to be included, as the very oppoſition ſheweth; and afterwards in the ſame chapter, ver. 24. <hi>The Word which ye have heard, is not mine, but the Fathers that ſent me.</hi> To which belong alſo many other Teſtimonies which are extant in the ſame Writer, chap. 8. 38, 40. and 15. 15, 17. and 8. 14. and chap. 3. 11, 32, 34. <hi>Wherein we read, that Chriſt ſaw thoſe things which he ſpake, with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, heard them from God, or the Father.</hi> And that they were given him from the Father, and that they were the words and ſpeech of God or the Father: from whence it is apparent that Chriſt is not the moſt high God.

Therefore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that he ſpake of himſelf how great ſoever, eſpecially ſince he wholly attributeth what he denyeth of himſelf, not to another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his, but to another Perſon, namely, the Father, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>her, that is, himſelf to the Father. For were that the meaning of the words, which the Adverſaries uſing that diſtinction, would have, he muſt have ſaid, My Doctrine is not mine according to the humane Nature, but according to the divine; or is mine, not as I am Man, but as I am God; and not, <hi>My Doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me;</hi> to wit, the Father. And in that paſſage, chap. 14.10. how unſuitable was it for him (were the Adverſaries Opinion true) having omitted the mention of his divine Nature, to ſay, <hi>But the Father that abideth or dwelleth in me, he doth the work?</hi> Where his words alſo are to be underſtood, as we have already hinted. For when he would intimate the intrinſecal cauſe of his work, or the cauſe dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in him, why did he not rather name his divine Nature, eſſentially dwelling in him, and proper to him, than a Perſon different from him? Why, when he had named the Father, did he, that he might more ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly exclude himſelf, preſently add the pronoun <hi>he,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, the Father ſimply doth the work? Is it not manifeſt that Chriſt would diſtinguiſh himſelf wholly, how great ſoever he is, from the prime Cauſe of his Works and Words, and having taken it away from himſelf, aſcribed it entirely to the Father? Add hereunto, that Chriſt when he ſaith, <hi>My</hi> Doctrine, or <hi>My</hi> Word, would have it ſo far forth underſtood, to be <hi>his</hi> Doctrine or Word, as it was moſt belonging unto him; and it was moſt his, according to the opinion of the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, as he was a divine Perſon; from whom, no leſs than from the Father, that Doctrine had originally proceeded. Wherefore when he had ſpoken this, and deſired to have it underſtood, there was no cauſe why he ſhould rather aſcribe it to the Father, then to himſelf, or his divine Nature, although divers natures had place in him. Finally, this thing doth here quite exclude the diſtinction of Natures, that Chriſt doth here manifeſtly conſider himſelf as he ſuſtained the Office
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64944:41"/> of a divine Embaſſadour. But that Office agreeth to none but a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as ſuch. Wherefore it is either to be held, that Chriſt here ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the divine Nature, or to be confeſſed that Chriſt is not a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſupream Divinity. For as we have ſhewn in the foregoing chapter, and will<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.</note> elſewhere ſhew more largely, a divine Perſon is nothing but the very divine Nature, having its ſubſiſtence. Beſides, the Adverſaries will have it, that Chriſt was firſt ſent according to his divine Nature; for they hold, that the Son was ſent from the Father out of Heaven, to aſſume Fleſh, and conſequently to undertake the buſineſs of Mans Salvation. But if Chriſt according to his divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yea, according to this in the firſt place, is the Embaſſadour of the Father, why are thoſe things which are attributed to him as the Embaſſadour of the Father, reſtrained to the humane Nature only, and not rather aſcribed to whole Chriſt, how great ſoever he is? But if any one will have it, that in theſe and other the like places, a Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative is attributed to the Father above Chriſt, and that as Chriſt is God, as indeed the words altogether require it, he muſt with all of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity confeſs, that Chriſt is not the moſt high God, but that on the contrary, the Father only (ſince ſuch a Prerogative agreeth to no other, and Chriſt aſcribeth to him entirely, without making mention of any other perſon, both his Doctrine and Works) is the moſt high God: concerning which thing it hath been ſpoken in the Defence of the precedent Arguments.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>LIke to the former are thoſe places, wherein Chriſt denyeth that he came of himſelf; affirming that he was ſent by the Father. For thus he ſpeaketh, chap. 7.28, 29. <hi>Whence I am, ye know; and I came not of my ſelf; but he is true that ſent me: whom ye know not: but I know him, becauſe I am from him; and he ſent me.</hi> And chap. 8.42. <hi>If God were your Father, you would love me, for I went out from God, and am come; for neither came I of my ſelf, but he ſent me.</hi> And chap. 5.43. he had ſaid, <hi>I am come in the name of my Father, and ye received me not; if another come in his own name, him ye will receive.</hi> But if Chriſt is the moſt high God, how did he not come of himſelf? For to come of ones ſelf, is to come of his own accord, or relying on his own Authority, and to diſcharge an office amongſt men. But how can the moſt high God be ſaid to do that, which he doth not of his own accord and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but anothers? Certainly although the Father and Son were divers Perſons in the ſame divine Eſſence, yet could not one be ſent, or come from the other, but he muſt withal come from himſelf, ſince there will be the ſame numerical will in both, the ſame Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

                  <p>IN the ſixth place, thoſe Teſtimonies are to be mentioned, wherein Chriſt denyed that he came to do his own will, but the will of the Father that ſent him. Which is a conſequent of that which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For it is the Office of an Embaſſadour, not to do and ſeek his own will, but the Will of the Sender. And hereunto belong the words of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 5.30. <hi>I ſeek not mine own will, but the Will of him that ſent me.</hi> And chap. 6.30. <hi>I deſcended from Heaven not to do mine own will, but the Will of him that ſent me;</hi> that is, of the Father, as appeareth from the following verſes, and many other places, and from the very thing it ſelf. But if Chriſt were the moſt high God, how did he not ſeek his own will, or not come to do it? For to what purpoſe had he come, but to do the will of the moſt high God? yea, by this very thing, whilſt he affirmeth, that he ſeeketh the Fathers Will, and came

But the deſcent of Chriſt agreeth to his whole Perſon, or, as the Adverſaries believe, to him according to the divine Nature. For they contend, that Chriſt according to the divine Nature came down from Heaven to be born of the Virgin; wherefore he ſpeaketh of his whole Perſon, and not only one part thereof, or if he attributed theſe things to himſelf in reſpect of one Nature only, he is according to the Opinion of the Adverſaries, to be imagined to ſpeak of the divine Nature, which overthroweth it ſelf.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>SEventhly, Hereunto belong thoſe words of the ſame Chriſt, chap. 8.50. <hi>I ſeek not mine own glory: there is one that ſeeketh and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> And thoſe words in the ſame chapter, ver. 54. <hi>If I glorifie my ſelf, my glory is nothing; it is my Father that glorifieth me.</hi> From the firſt of which we may thus reaſon. If Chriſt had been the moſt high God, he could not chuſe but ſeek his own glory: Since the end of all Gods actions, and the ultimate ſcope of them that are ſent by him, or miniſter to him, is the Glory of God himſelf: Wherefore if Chriſt had been the moſt high God, he could not chuſe but ſeek his own glory. Again, ſince he openly profeſſeth, that he ſeeketh his Glory that ſent him, namely, the Fathers, chap. 7.18. If he had been of the ſame Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with the Father, and the ſame God with him, in ſeeking his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he had alſo ſought his own. Beſides, when he ſaith, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth ſeek his glory, and judge, or glorifie him, it would of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity happen, that Chriſt himſelf alſo at the ſame time, and with the ſame labour, doth ſeek his own glory, and judge, and conſequently
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64944:43"/> doth glorifie himſelf, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>7</label> 
                     <note place="margin">Chriſt did not ſeek his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> ſince, as we formerly hinted, they that have the ſame numerical Eſſence, the ſame will and power of working, muſt alſo of neceſſity have the ſame numerical operation. Whence the Adverſaries alſo hold, that the works of the Trinity performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, as they ſpeak, are undivided, although the reaſon of that Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, doth not admit a limitation; and although it ſhould be admitted, yet here, according to the opinion of the Adverſaries, muſt needs be the ſame operation, becauſe they conſtitute, and are inforced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute that glorification either in the exhaltation of the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or in the manifeſtation of Chriſts glory before men. But now we ſee that Chriſt openly denies that he ſeeketh his own glory, or doth glorifie himſelf.</p>
                  <p>From the latter place we thus conclude, If Chriſt were the moſt high God, he could not ſay his glory would be nothing, if he glorifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For how is the Glory which proceedeth from the moſt high God, or wherewith the moſt high God glorifieth himſelf, how, I ſay, is it nothing? that is, vain and empty? Certainly it would be no more vain than the Glory that proceedeth from the Father. But Chriſt openly ſaith, that if he glorified himſelf, his glory is nothing, and oppoſeth the glorification proceeding from the Father, as true and ſolid, to the glorification proceeding from himſelf.</p>

Wherefore that we may return unto our place; whilſt Chriſt conſtituteth himſelf the object of Faith, but in the mean time denieth that he is the principal object, and ultimate end thereof, he ſpeaketh of himſelf as the Son of God. But that he according to the humane Nature only is the Son of God, the Adverſaries will not grant. Add hereunto, that he conſidereth himſelf as Embaſſadour of the Father; for credit given to an Embaſſadour as ſuch, is ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terminated not in him, but the Sender, ſince his Authority doth depend from thence, and he propoſeth not his own ſayings, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, namely, the Senders.

But thoſe things which are attributed to Chriſt as Embaſſadour of the Father, are to be referred to Chriſt how great ſoever he is; and if he be a perſon of ſupream Divinity, are to be aſcribed even to the divine Nature; as we have formerly ſhewn, chap. 4. of this Section.

                        </gap>fficulty of this teſtimony, fled to the refuge of ſaying, that the place was corrupted, and that this was not to be read, namely, <hi>neither the Son but the Father,</hi> contrary to the credit of all books; which if we may call into queſtion, there will be nothing in the Scripture cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, nothing firm, nothing which one may not deny. Neither muſt we only expunge the words of <hi>Mark,</hi> but alſo thoſe of <hi>Matthew,</hi> which are of the ſame import. Next, the ſame Interpreter ſaith, that the greater part of the antient Authors were of opinion, that Chriſt was ignorant of the day of judgement, not becauſe himſelf was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ignorant thereof, but becauſe he made us ignorant of it, becauſe he would not reveal it to us; becauſe his Body, that is the Church, was ignorant of it, becauſe he diſſembled the knowledge thereof; and to that purpoſe he cites <hi>Origen, Chryſoſtome, Gregory, Hierom, Beda, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilact.</hi> This Interpretation (if ſo be it deſerves this name) the ſame Interpreter doth rightly confute by this Argument, becauſe at that rate the Father alſo would be ignorant of the day of judgement, in that he revealed it not unto us. Again, what manner of reaſoning had Chriſt uſed, were this Interpretation admitted? The Diſciples de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know of him the day of judgement, Chriſt anſwereth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the opinion of theſe men, <hi>The Son cauſeth you to be ignorant of the day of judgement, he will not reveal it,</hi> he diſſembleth his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof. But this was the very thing that the Diſciples ask, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he will declare it unto them. A cauſe ſhould have been alledged why he would not declare it, why, as they ſpeak, he did diſſemble it. Finally, what manner of Interpretation is this: <hi>I know not,</hi> that is, I diſſemble my knowledge? Did Chriſt deal thus with his Diſciples,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64944:44"/> and delude them with whom he both might and ought to deal open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Such a kind of ſpeech would be unbecoming even a grave man, much more Chriſt.

                        </gap>e of it. This opinion he refuteth with the ſame reaſon that he did the former; becauſe by this reckoning, the Father alſo ſhould be ignorant of it, ſince neither he himſelf as yet had experience of it. He ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>th, that others affirm this to be the ſence, <hi>Neither doth the Son of man know it, unleſs the Father know it;</hi> but becauſe the Father knows it, the Son of man alſo knowes it, as <hi>Enthymius</hi> ſpeaketh. Which Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is very frivolous; firſt, in that by ſo ſpeaking, he had not alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cauſe, why he declared not the day of judgement to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, nor had diminiſhed the deſire of knowing it, and inquiring it of him, but increaſt it; becauſe by this means he had intimated, that the Son of man did know that day. Beſides, neither doth the word <hi>Son,</hi> abſolutely ſpoken of Chriſt, denote the Son of man, but the Son of God, as he is ſuch, eſpecially ſince the word Father is preſently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed thereunto, and by it God underſtood; and the word <hi>but,</hi> in that paſſage, <hi>but the Father,</hi> agreeth not with the words, <hi>nor the Son,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately going before, but with thoſe, <hi>none knoweth.</hi> Finally, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation doth thwart the words of <hi>Matthew,</hi> who ſaith, that <hi>the Father only knoweth it.</hi> For how ridiculous would it be to ſay, the Son of man knoweth not the day of judgement, unleſs the Father on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knoweth it? for it is a certain contradiction in the Additament, and the condition that is added, ſubverteth that to which it is added. The ſame Interpreter furthermore ſaith, that many antient and grave Authors, whoſe names he orderly reckoneth up, did thus interpret, That Chriſt, as man, was ignorant of the day of judgement. Which he himſelf thinketh to be true only in this ſence, that Chriſt knew not the day of judgement upon that ſcore, or for that reaſon, becauſe he was man, but becauſe he was God. Otherwiſe he ſuppoſeth it to be falſe, and horrid to be ſpoken, that the humane Nature of Chriſt was ignorant of any thing. For the Papiſts, yea, certain others alſo, imagine, that the humane Nature of Chriſt, from the very firſt inſtant of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and birth, knew all things. But that Interpretation alſo he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth, becauſe Chriſt not only denyeth, that the Son of man (he ought here rather to ſay the Son of <hi>God</hi>) doth know the day of judgment; but alſo affirmeth, that <hi>the Father only knoweth it;</hi> by which ſpeech he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to exclude, not only the Son, but alſo the holy Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, now a-dayes that Interpretation which the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rejecteth, namely, that Chriſt is ſaid truly to be ignorant of the day of judgement, not according to the divine, but according to the humane Nature, is commonly moſt received even amongſt them, who otherwiſe hold, that in the very moment of conception, the Properties of the divine Nature were communicated to the humane, or the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all things infuſed into the ſoul of Chriſt: therefore we muſt here briefly refute it, and having diſcuſt it in a few words, alſo diſprove that mans own interpretation.</p>

Where it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that he ſpake of himſelf wholly, how great ſoever he is; as we have ſhewn in the examination of the ſecond Anſwer to that place, <hi>John</hi> 5.19. Again, to omit other things ſpoken in the ſame place, both from the ſimple word <hi>Son</hi> oppoſed to God the Father, and alſo by the Gradations uſed by Chriſt, aſcending from the Angels to the Son, and from the Son to the Father, it is apparent that he altogether ſpake of that Nature according to which he is the Son of God. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Becauſe in <hi>Matthew</hi> it is expreſly ſaid, that the Father only know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the day and hour of judgement: which ſenſe agreeth alſo to the words of <hi>Mark,</hi> whilſt he ſaith, <hi>None knoweth but the Father,</hi> oppoſing the Father to the Son himſelf. But if Chriſt had according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, known the day of judgement, then not only the Father, but alſo the Son had known it, and beſides, if we believe the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the holy Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Now whereas in this place they ſo much urge the ſaying of <hi>Paul, Col.</hi> 2.3. <hi>In whom are all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge hidden.</hi> Firſt, they do not obſerve, that theſe words may as well, yea, far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, be referred to the name of the Myſtery of God and Chriſt; the mention whereof immediately precedeth, than to the name of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For it is there chiefly treated concerning the knowledge therof, ſo that the ſence is, in the Myſtery of God and Chriſt, are all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge hidden; but that Myſtery is the evangelical Doctrine, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.25, 26, 27. Again, the <hi>Wiſdom and Knowledge</hi> here ſpoken of, is to be underſtood of all things pertaining to mans Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which have alſo been revealed by Chriſt unto us, and are diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be known by us. But that the Knowledge of the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not comprehended in the number of theſe things, appeareth from theſe very words of Chriſt, wherof we diſpute. To omit, although otherwiſe it were ſpoken of the ſame kind of things, yet this ſpecial ſaying concerning the day of judgement, ſhould derogate from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and not be interpreted according to that, but that according to it. It remaineth that we ſpeak ſomething of that Interpretation and Anſwer which the Popiſh Interpreter, having refuted the Opinions of all the reſt, did deviſe, although he ſo propoſed it, as that himſelf ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to put no great confidence in it; for he ſaith, <hi>

                        <q>Wherefore he intimateth what is more; that he not only as a man, but alſo as God, was in a certain ſort igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the day of judgment, not that he was indeed ignorant; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not his office to know, as he ſaid not, for whom it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by <hi>me, but by my Father,</hi> not that it was not provided by him alſo; but becauſe to provide the Kingdom, that is, to predeſtinate, is not his office, but the Fathers. That alſo it belongeth to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64944:45"/> to appoint when the world is to be diſſolved, and when the day of judgment is to be. This is that which the Apoſtle ſaith,<note n="†" place="margin">
                              <hi>Acts</hi> 1.7.</note> 
                           <hi>It is not for you to know the times and ſeaſons which the Father hath put in his own power.</hi> Therefore he alone is ſignified to know it. And this, unleſs I be miſtaken, is the true ſence.</q> He did well, twice to add <hi>unleſs I be miſtaken;</hi> for he was ſomething afraid, leſt he ſhould be miſtaken; neither did this ingenious man ſatisfie himſe f, whilſt he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſatisfie others. But neither did he rightly explain the place, but pervert it, nor take away the difficulty, but in ſome part augment it. For, firſt, he without example, and any juſt reaſon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth from the proper and uſual ſignification, of being ignorant, whilſt he interprets it, that it is not ones duty to know, unleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he alledge this very thing for a reaſon about which we contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, namely, That it cannot be ſaid that the Son is ignorant of the day of judgment, becauſe he ever knew, as all other things, ſo that day al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Again, in what manner ſoever he interpreteth thoſe words, it is not the office of the Son to know that day, yet doth he not eſcape the difficulty; for either it is not therefore the office of Chriſt, becauſe he is not bound to know that day, or not obliged to know that day, or becauſe he is bound to be ignorant of that day; ſo that it is not ſo much as lawful for him to know it; which latter ſence, the places quoted by him, ſeem to require. If he hold the latter, he encreaſeth the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty inſtead of diminiſhing it, and ſaith more than is needful. For he not only ſaith, that the Son was then ignorant of the day of judgment, but that it was not ſo much as lawful for him to know it. But how can he be the moſt high God, who is not only ignorant of ſomething, but cannot know it, or to whom it is not ſo much as lawful to know ſomethings, and that as he is God? And notwithſtanding the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces quoted by him, and duly compared with this, ſeem altogether to require ſuch a ſence; for when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>To ſit at my right hand and left hand, is not mine to give,</hi> he ſignifieth, that it lay not in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and diſpoſal, or that it was not lawful for him to do it. But the place of the <hi>Acts</hi> maketh expreſs mention of Power, and ſignifieth that the Father had reſerved to his own power and diſpoſal the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and conſequently alſo the knowledge of the times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But if he grant the former, firſt, what will this make to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? for the ſence will be, that none is obliged to know the day of judgment, neither the Angels, nor the Son, <hi>but the Father only.</hi> But what then? although neither Men, nor the Angels, nor the Son be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to know it, yet both he and they may poſſibly know it, and we, (as the Diſciples may be ſuppoſed to ſpeak) although we are not bound, are yet deſirous to know it, ſince, ſaving the truth of that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is poſſible for us to know it. For he againſt whom we diſpute, doth believe, that although it were not the office of Chriſt to know the day of judgment, yet he did know it. By this reckoning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Chriſt had not quenched the deſire and longing that the Apoſtles had to know that day, but had left place for ſuch a cogitation, that it might be, that both Men and Angels did know that day. Again how
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64944:46"/> can it be ſaid, that it is the Office of the Father, or that the Father is obliged to know the day of judgment, and the Son not obliged, if he alſo be the Supream, and conſequently the ſame God with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? for neither of them can be obliged to know any thing, but that the other alſo muſt be obliged, ſince both have the ſame nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical underſtanding, and the ſelf-ſame knowledge. Beſides, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cauſe you alledge, why the Father is obliged to know the day of judgment, that will be common to the Son, if he be the ſupream God with the Father; yea, were it poſſible, that one of them ſhould be obliged thereunto, the other not at all or leſs obliged; it ſhould be held, that Chriſt is more obliged, becauſe he ſuſtaineth the Office of Judge; and if he be the ſupream God, doth therein depend on none; ſo that he doth according to his own pleaſure both conſtitute and determine the day of judgment. I omit that it is not rightly ſaid, that it is the Fathers Office, or that he is bound to know the day of judgment, ſince he cannot chuſe but know; or if you therefore ſay, it is his Office becauſe he is bound to define and conſtitute that day, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how rightly it is ſaid, that he is bound to do that which lyeth in his own pleaſure.

                  <p>THe next place ſhall be that which a certain Interpreter, as we have ſeen, compared with that teſtimony whereof we have hitherto treated, and is extant in the ſame <hi>Matthew,</hi> chap. 20. where Chriſt ſpeaketh thus, <hi>But to ſit at the right and left hand, is not mine to give:</hi> So it is read in the Greek without adding <hi>to you,</hi> which is found in the vulgar Tranſlation, <hi>But to whom it hath been prepared by my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Now it is eaſie to every one to perceive, what the meaning of Chriſt is; namely, that it is not in his power, or not lawful for him a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For that this is due to them, for whom it hath been deſigned by the Father, whoſe Decrees Chriſt cannot repeal. From whence it appeareth, that Chriſt denyeth ſuch Authority to himſelf, as he intimateth, that the Father exerciſeth. Whence it followeth, that Chriſt is not the moſt high God. For in the Power and Pleaſure of the moſt high God, are all things which fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any power, ſuch as is that, namely, to give or decree that one ſhould ſit at the right hand; another at the left hand of Chriſt in his Kingdom: for Chriſt intimateth, that that hath been prepared for ſome by the Father.</p>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64944:47"/> high God. But, firſt, no reaſon enforceth us to imagine, that the words <hi>to you</hi> are either to be read or underſtood; but there is rather good reaſon, why we ſhould conceive that they are not to be read. For as for the authority of the antient Interpreter, there is no cauſe why we ſhould leave the Fountain, and follow the Stream, and think that this is purer than that; yea, rather the reading of the Latin Tranſlation ought to yeild to the reading of the Greek Copies, if they agree among themſelves, &amp; to be corrected from it. But here the Greek cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies among themſelves, and that not only in <hi>Matthew,</hi> but alſo in <hi>Mark,</hi> where it is read in the ſame manner, and that moſt learned Popiſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter ſaith, he knoweth no antient Greek Interpreter, who read the words <hi>to you,</hi> yea, not ſo much as <hi>Auſtin</hi> amongſt the <hi>Latins.</hi> But as for the reaſons drawn from the following words, that do perſwade us, that in the foregoing words, a regard is alſo had of thoſe perſons, to whom it concerned not Chriſt to give that ſitting at his right hand and left; but there it followeth not, that the words <hi>to you</hi> muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity ſo be underſtood, and ſo this great felicity is denyed to thoſe two Diſciples by name. For every one ſeeth, that theſe words may thus alſo be rightly underſtood, as if Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>To ſit at the right and left hand is not mine to give,</hi> namely, to whom ſoever I pleaſe, even to my kinſmen, ſuch as you are, having a regard to kindred only, or to give it to ſuch as ſimply ask, and therein prevent others as you do, but to them at length to whom it hath been deſigned by my Father. Again, let us grant, that thoſe words, <hi>to you,</hi> are either to be read, or to be underſtood. Nevertheleſs, ſince Chriſt ſaith, that it is not his to give that ſitting, but to them for whom it hath been prepared by the Father, it followeth that he is not the moſt high God. For by ſuch words he intimateth, that he is not the prime Author of ſo great Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but the Father, and that he himſelf doth both promiſe, and will at length give that honour, according to the pleaſure of another, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of the Father, and the Laws appointed by him; otherwiſe, as we before hinted, he would have ſaid, that ſo great dignity had for ſome been provided either by himſelf, or at leaſt by him &amp; the Father toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But neither of thoſe things which we have ſpoken, is incident to the moſt high God; for he is both the prime Author of all ſuch Honours and Rewards, and compoſeth himſelf to the pleaſure of his own, not of anothers will, and accordingly diſtributeth rewards and honours.</p>
                     <p>The exception concerning the humane Nature, according to which it was not his to give, whereas it was according to the divine, hath here no place, both for the ſimple negation, and alſo becauſe he here oppoſeth not one Nature to another, but his own Perſon to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Father, and what he taketh away from himſelf, he attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to him; and finally, becauſe this reaſon would have had no force to repeal the petition of thoſe Diſciples; for neither did they deſire, that he ſhould give unto them what they craved, according to one Nature, not according to another, but ſimply that he ſhould give it, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he ſhould give it according as he is able. Therefore if Chriſt had anſwered, that it was not his to give according to the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64944:47"/> they might preſently reply, that it did nothing matter them, ſo that he gave it according to the divine, according to which he was able to give it. But they were nor ſo ſubtil, although they believed Chriſt to be the Son of God, as to think of that diſtinction. Therefore they thought that a ſimple Negative was ſimply to be taken, and believed, that<note n="*" place="margin">John Maldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat.</note> Chriſt ſpake to the purpoſe, and did not ſtruggle beſides the matter in hand.

                     <hi>Why doſt thou call me good, there is none good but one, the God,</hi> or <hi>God only:</hi> which place, both heretofore, and at this day, many have dared ſo to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, as if Chriſt would by the confeſſion of that young man, teach, that himſelf was that one or moſt high God. Which if we ſhew to be falſe, the Argument will be preſently retorted upon them, and it will appear, that the contrary to what they will have, is here taken for granted by Chriſt. They indeed believe Chriſt to reaſon in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>None is good, but God,</hi> namely, the moſt high God. I by thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion am good, I therefore am the moſt high God. But, firſt, Chriſt no where, though he had far greater occaſions of doing ſo, did either expreſly ſay, or openly teach, that he is God, as will appear to every one reading the Hiſtory of the Goſpel; yea, as we have above ſome where hinted, when it was objected againſt him, that he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf God, he purpoſely declined the name of <hi>God,</hi> and profeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the <hi>Son of God,</hi> ſo<note n="*" place="margin">

But this is falſe, ſince, beſides Chriſt, the Father is ſuch; namely, that God, of whom, as different from himſelf, he elſewhere very frequently, and in the ſame diſcourſe ſpeaketh. But if any one ſay, that Chriſt would have it underſtood, that there was no other in regard of Eſſence, to whom the name of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> taken by way of excellency, doth agree; howbeit, that there is another in regard of Perſon, he will take for granted, what all acknowledge to be moſt falſe, that the young man already kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>w how to diſtinguiſh between the Eſſence and Perſon, and that it was apparent unto him, that many divine Perſons might be in one numerical Eſſence, or he would be forced to ſay, that Chriſt did by this ſpeech of his, drive the young man, ignorant of that diſtinction, into a moſt grievous errour; namely, to believe that there was no other Perſon beſides Chriſt, to whom the name of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> ſo taken as we have ſaid, doth agree. Could it be that Chriſt ſhould touch ſo great a matter ſo briefly, and not inſtruct an ignorant man concerning it? Finally, the very words of Chriſt, <hi>Why doſt thou call me good? there is none good but God only,</hi> do openly enough teach, that Chriſt rejected ſo great a title, as agreeing to God only; ſo far was he from ſnatching it, to conclude thence a thing as yet more incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; namely, that he was the moſt high God. What then will you ſay, will not Chriſt be good? We anſwer, That the word <hi>Good,</hi> when it is ſo taken, as to agree only to the moſt high God, in which manner it is here done by Chriſt, as we have<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.</note> before hinted, taken by way of excellency, and denoteth him who is in the moſt perfect manner of all, and of himſelf, good. In which ſort we have elſewhere ſeen, that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power and Immortality, is taken, when God only is ſaid to be Wiſe, Powerful and Immortal. In this ſignification, Chriſt denyeth that he is good. For if you object, that the<note n="†" place="margin">See Sect. <hi>1.</hi> defence of the firſt Argument</note> young man, did not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply call Chriſt <hi>Good,</hi> but <hi>Good Maſter,</hi> and ſo took not the word Good in ſo perfect a ſignification, but in ſuch an one as might agree to a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, given by God. We anſwer, That the young man did both in an unuſual manner, ſo<note n="*" place="margin">That is, ſpoke to.</note> accoſt Chriſt, <hi>O good Maſter,</hi> in which manner we no where find, that he is at any other time ſtiled, and alſo would in a ſingular faſhion call him good, and attribute this name unto him by a certain excellency. Now although he thought not of ſo perfect a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification as agreeth to God only, yet ſuch an appellation, by reaſon of its ſingularity, receding from the common cuſtom, ſeemed to favour of a ſignification ſo perfect, and ſo of a certain Divinity. It became the great Modeſty of Chriſt, not to admit this title, as truly agreeing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God, but to decline and reject it. And this was far more becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than to draw this title, uttered in another ſence, to the Confeſſion of his ſupream Deity. In like manner, the ſame Chriſt below, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.8, 9, 10. admoniſheth his Diſciples, that they ſuffer not themſelves, to be adorned with the titles of <hi>Rabbies</hi> and <hi>Maſters,</hi> becauſe there is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64944:48"/> one Maſter of ours, the Chriſt; nor that they call any one on Earth Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe there is one Father of ours, who is in the Heavens. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perhaps they who called them <hi>Rabby,</hi> or Maſter, did not at all think of ſo perfect a ſignification, wherein thoſe Appellations did agree to none but Chriſt, yea, although it were not ſo much as likely, that they did think, neither alſo did we take the name of the Father in ſo excellent a ſignification, wherein it agreed to none but the moſt high God: for it is ſufficient, that ſuch a cuſtom of<note n="*" place="margin">That is ſpeaking to.</note> accoſting, doth ſavour of ſomething too much, and conſequently of ſomething more divine, which agreeth to none but Chriſt, or to the moſt high God; for Modeſty doth ſhun even thoſe things alſo which have a ſhew of too much. What therefore the Maſter of moſt perfect Humility in thoſe words taught the Diſciples, that in this place of ours, did he teach by example, whilſt he rejected the title of <hi>Good,</hi> as too much, and proper to God only. Hence alſo it is apparent, that Chriſt reaſons far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than the Adverſaries, and conſequently after a contrary manner, namely, thus, <hi>None is good but God, namely, the moſt high God: which is all one as if he ſhould ſay, Whoſoever is good, namely, by way of Ex el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, he is the moſt high God: But I am not the moſt high God, wherefore I am not good, taking this name by way of excellency; neither was I ſo to be called by thee.</hi>

                     <hi>Not my will, but thine be done.</hi> For from thoſe words it is collected, that Chriſt is not the moſt high God; for the moſt high God neither permitteth, nor can permit to any other perſon a power to determine of him, and alſo to decree contrary to what himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and wills; otherwiſe, by this very act, he would acknowledge that perſon ſuperiour to himſelf. But nothing is ſuperiour to the moſt high God. Whereas Chriſt permitteth here to another Perſon, namely, his Father a Power to determine of him, and to decree even contrary to what he himſelf otherwiſe willed. Again, had Chriſt been the moſt high God, he had alſo been one and the ſame God with the Father, as the Adverſaries themſelves contend, or of one Eſſence with him, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there would be two moſt high Gods. But it is apparent from this place, that Chriſt was not the ſame with the Father, or of the ſame Eſſence with him: for had he been, he would likewiſe have had one numerical will with the Father, and the ſame numerical act of the will, as we have above<note n="*" place="margin">This Section.

                     <head>The Defence of the Argument.</head>
                     <p>IT will be here preſently anſwered, that it is manifeſtly apparent, from the words, that Chriſt ſpeaketh thus according to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, not according to the divine. And indeed we believe, that Chriſt according to the humane Nature, or the very humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf, doth here ſpeak, but ſo, that it is withal to be granted, that there is not in him another Nature, namely, the divine. For, firſt, the ſimple Negation, <hi>Not my will be done,</hi> permitteth not that there was another Nature in Chriſt, and that a better, according to which his own will ought altogether to be done, as it would be neceſſary to hold, if there had been in Chriſt the divine Nature, the ſame in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with that of the Father. To omit, that it is abſurd, yea, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impoſſible, that in Chriſt at the ſame time, there ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wills concerning the ſame thing; whereof the one would have the cup paſs from him, the other would not. Certainly it would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al be neceſſary to acknowledge two Perſons in him. For, to ſubjoyn another reaſon for which that diſtinction of Natures hath here no place, it is neceſſary that Chriſt ſpake theſe things of himſelf as he is a Perſon; for ſuch operations as are, to will, and conſequently alſo to beg, agree to none but Suppoſitums, endued with underſtanding, as ſuch; and conſequently, to none but perſons as ſuch. Either there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſary for the Adverſaries to hold, that Chriſt ſpake theſe things of himſelf as he is a divine Perſon, namely, one of the Perſons of the Trinity; which we have ſhewn to be falſe, and they themſelves, who here uſe a diſtinction of Natures, do acknowledge: or it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to acknowledge, that his humane Nature, according to which Chriſt willed and begged thoſe things, is a Perſon; and ſo, leſt two Perſons ſhould with the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> be h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>HItherto we have cited places out of the Writers of the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hiſtory, and conſequently out of none but the words of Chriſt himſelf, wherein thoſe things are denied of Chriſt, which could by no means be denyed of him, if he were the moſt high God. To which we think fit to ſubjoyn thoſe words of the divine Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which are extant, chap. 5.4, 5. <hi>Neither taketh any one the Honour to himſelf</hi> (namely, of the Pontificiate or high Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood) <hi>but he that is called by God, as Aaron. So alſo Chriſt did not glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelf to become an high Prieſt, but he that ſaid unto him, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> For if Chriſt were the moſt high God, how had he not glorified himſelf to become an high Prieſt, if ſo be the moſt high God can be any high Prieſt? Whereof hereafter. For on the moſt high God, the honour of an high Prieſthood doth depend, and ſo is conferred on others. And in that the Father glorified him to become an high Prieſt, as here it is affirmed; Chriſt had alſo glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, to become an high Prieſt, had he been the moſt high God, and ſo one God with the Father. But that is in this place denyed, and he that ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou art my Son,</hi> is ſaid to have glorified him, and not he himſelf.</p>

                     <head>The Defence of the Argument.</head>
                     <p>THe exception concerning two Natures, hath no more place here, than in the former places; both for the ſimple Negation, as alſo becauſe Chriſt is here conſidered as he hath attained the Prieſtly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which agreeth to him only as he is a Perſon. But if that be a Perſon of ſupream Divinity, thoſe things which are here either ſpoken or denyed of Chriſt, muſt be attributed or denyed of the very divine Nature. Since a Perſon of ſupream Divinity is nothing but the divine Nature endued with a ſubſiſtence. Add hereunto, that thoſe things which are here attributed unto Chriſt, are aſcribed to him as he is the Son of God; for the divine Author doth not therefore take thoſe words of the ſecond <hi>Pſalm,</hi> that he may only ſimply deſcribe him that glorified Chriſt, and made him high Prieſt, but that this very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription may teach, that Chriſt was made an high Prieſt by God. For beſides the cuſtom both of this and other divine Authors, who are wont to make uſe of Deſcriptions of Perſons accommodated to the ſubject matter, not forreign to the matter; the following words alſo
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64944:50"/> ſhew this thing; for the divine Author addeth, <hi>As he alſo ſaith in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedec.</hi> By which words it clearly appeareth, that in the former place alſo it is ſpoken of the Prieſthood which was given unto Chriſt. But that place is not commonly to be taken of Chriſt according to the divine Nature, and to be wreſted to his Generation out of the Eſſence which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made from all Eternity; which though it be abſurd, and beſides other things, repugnant to the words of <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 13.32, 33. &amp; ſo to this very place, doth yet exclude their exception concerning the humane Nature, according to which this very place is to be taken of Chriſt. Finally, would the divine Author here have ſpoken of a certain Nature only, and not of the whole Perſon of Chriſt, he would not have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Chriſt to the Father, but to himſelf according to the divine Nature, and what he had taken away from the humane, he would have attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the divine; but that he neither did, nor could do. For if Chriſt was in that very thing made an high Prieſt by God, as he was begotten by God, and conſequently became the Son of God; as we manifeſtly ſee the divine Author intimates; he could not be made an high Prieſt by himſelf, no not conſidered according to the divine Nature; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Chriſt would have been begotten of himſelf, conſidered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the divine Nature, and ſo would be his own Son, and the divine Nature might ſay to him, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> Which how abſurd it is, and repugnant to its ſelf, every one percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth. Now therefore he at length ſhall rightly underſtand this place, and the Authors reaſoning, who obſerves that Chriſt is chiefly called the Son of God, as by his favour he hath attained the greateſt ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with God; and that Chriſt was never made more like to God, than when he obtained the perpetual Government of the houſe of God, and the Office of eternally looking to, and ſaving the People of God. Which thing is contained in this Prieſthood; for the divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor oppoſeth nor that Office to the Kingly, but in ſome ſort includeth this in that. But let thoſe things be here ſpoken by the by, in that they will prove advantagious hereafter.</p>

                     <head>The Defence of the Argument.</head>
                     <p>HEre many of the antient Authors did grant, that Chriſt ſpeaketh of himſelf, even as he is the Son of God, and ſaith that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is greater than himſelf, in as much as the name of Father ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Principle, and as the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſpeak, the cauſe of the Son. Thus beſides others, that Popiſh Interpreter,<note n="*" place="margin">John Maldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus.</note> whom we have above quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſaith, it is expounded by <hi>Athanaſius, Hilary, Epiphanius, Gregory Nazianzen, Ceſarius, Cyril, Damaſcen, Chryſoſtom, Leontius, Theophilact, Euthymius,</hi> citing the places of them to that purpoſe. <hi>But I know not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>whether they granted more to the Adverſaries</hi> (namely, the <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> with whom they did diſpute) <hi>than was meet.</hi> Indeed this acute man ſaw, that it followeth thence, that Chriſt even as he is the Son of God, is not the moſt high God, in that the Father is greater than he, as ſuch: concerning which thing, we have already above<note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.</note> ſufficiently ſpoken. Add hereunto, that that faſhion wherein they make the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greater than Chriſt, makes nothing to the purpoſe of Chriſt; for Chriſt there renders a reaſon of that which he had laſt ſpoken, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>If ye love me, ye would rejoyce becauſe I go to the Father.</hi> By which words he ſignifieth, that ſome good or happineſs ſhould arrive to him, when he was gone away to the Father, and conſequently, that the Diſciples ought to rejoyce even for his ſake, that he went away to the Father; as very learned men before us have obſerved. But what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it to the purpoſe, that the Father is greater than Chriſt, as he is the Fountain of his divine either Nature or Perſon, and begat him from Eternity out of his Eſſence? doth not the thing it ſelf hint, that Chriſt would ſignifie, that the Father was greater than he, as he was more bleſſed, glorious, powerful? and that he himſelf, when he was more nearly joyned with the Father, and received into his own ſeat, ſhould be partaker of the ſame Bleſſedneſs, Glory, Power and Empire? But there is no need to labour much in refuting the Interpretation of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64944:51"/> the Antients, ſince at this day there is ſcarce any one that followeth it. For latter Writers obſerving, that by ſuch an Interpretation, the <hi>Arrians</hi> Opinion touching the Divinity of Chriſt, is not a little eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they chiefly ſeized on that anſwer, which alſo not a few of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients made uſe, that Chriſt there ſpake not of himſelf according to the divine, but only according to the humane Nature. Which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer may be refuted by the ſame reaſon in a manner, which above, chap. 3. of this Section, we alledged, if you change a few things in ſome of them. For not to repeat thoſe things now, whereby we have taught, that there is no example of ſuch a diſtinction in the Scriptures, yea, that this very diſtinction overthroweth the Opinion of the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries concerning the Perſon of Chriſt, we have ſhewn that that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſimply denyed of the whole, which may, and is wont, or rather altogether ought to be ſimply affirmed of the ſame, although it agree not to it according to ſome one part, eſpecially the leſs worthy. Whence it followeth, that alſo on the contrary, that cannot be ſimply affirmed of ſome whole, which may, and is wont, or rather ought to be ſimply denyed of the ſame whole, although it doth agree to it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſome part, eſpecially the leſs worthy. Now if Chriſt be the moſt high God equal to the Father in all things, as the Adverſaries affirm, and that without any limitation, and ſimply; yea, ought ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to be denyed of him, that the Father is greater than he. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it more lawful ſimply to affirm of him, that he is the moſt high God, and equal to the Father in all things, than to deny that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is greater than he, or that he is leſs than the Father. Wherefore neither could Chriſt ſimply affirm of himſelf, if he were the moſt high God, that the Father is greater than he. Add hereunto, that ſuch an affirmation, <hi>My Father is greater than I,</hi> is of equal force with ſuch a Negation, <hi>I am not ſo great as my Father;</hi> as every one ſeeth by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the ſcope of theſe words before mentioned by us, doth teach; for Chriſt would ſignifie, that he did yet want ſomething which the Father hath; and therefore that he alſo may attain the ſame, he muſt go away unto the Father. Wherefore ſince we have taught, that what may or ought to be ſimply affirmed of the whole, cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed of the ſame whole; Chriſt could not thus ſpeak of himſelf, if for another, and that a better Nature, he would have the contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of him. Again, ſince he who ſpeaketh is the very Son of God; for he ſaith, <hi>My Father is greater than I;</hi> thereby intimating, that God the Father is greater than his Son: either it is neceſſary to ſay, that the Father is greater than the very divine Nature of Chriſt, which the Adverſaries by that very diſtinction of theirs, endeavour to avoid, or confeſs that the Son of God is not a perſon of ſupream Deity, ſince a perſon of ſupream Deity, is no other than the very divine Nature having its ſubſiſtence; as we have above ſaid, chap. 3. Beſides, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Adverſaries, doth altogether enervate the force of Chriſts words, and render them invalid to his purpoſe. For we ſaw that therefore Chriſt uttered thoſe words, that the Diſciples might ſee that he muſt go away to the Father, to the end he might enjoy
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64944:51"/> greater happineſs; and therefore ſhould not only abſtain from ſorrow, but alſo rejoyce that he went a way: but if Chriſt according to one Nature only, had been leſs than the Father, and in the mean time, had in himſelf a Nature or Perſon equal to the Father in all things, there would have been no need for him to go to the Father as greater, to the end he might enjoy greater happineſs; nor would the Diſciples have had cauſe to rejoyce that he went away from them, but rather to grieve, in that he would go away, where as he might ſtay, and they might preſently object to the Lord, yea, why doſt thou go away to the Father as greater than thou, ſince thou art endued with ſuch a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Perſon as is equal to the Father in all things, and that N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ture is alwayes intimately preſent with thee, even whilſt thou art conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with us on the Earth; why rather doſt thou not ſtay with us, and here procure to thy ſelf that happineſs which thou ſeekeſt with the Father? You ſee, that by this reaſon, if it be taken according to the ſenſe of the Adverſaries, Chriſt could have prevailed nothing with the Diſciples. But he could prevail very much, if omitting the diſtinction of Natures, he would have the words taken of him ſimply and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, as they were uttered.</p>
                     <p>But there are ſome learned men of the Adverſaries, who think that thoſe words of Chriſt, as alſo many other places in the ſame <hi>John,</hi> are to be taken neither of the humane Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ure of Chriſt, nor of the divine, but of the whole complex,<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>John Calvins</hi> Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in <hi>Poland.</hi>
                        </note> as they ſpeak; becauſe although he were the eternal God, yet when he deſcended to us, he began to be a middle perſon between God and us. But this is of no moment; for either they will have it, that the Son, when he d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſcended to us, ceaſed to be the moſt high God, or they will not have it. If they will have it, the Son neither is, nor ever was the moſt high God; for he can never ceaſe to be the moſt high God. If they will not have it, the Son could not therefore be ſimply called leſs than the Father, or, which is all one, the Father greater than he; becauſe none is ſimply, yea none is any way greater than the moſt high God. And if the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Adverſaries concerning Chriſt, be true, the Son ought to be termed equal to the Father in all things. But as we have ſhewn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the ſame cannot be ſimply both affirmed and denyed of the ſame whole. Again, ſince that whole complex whereof they ſay, that thoſe words of Chriſt are to be taken, is the Perſon of Chriſt, or the very Son of God; as neither they do deny, and we have before ſhewn; it is neceſſary for them to confeſs, either that that Perſon is not a Perſon of ſupream Deity, or elſe that it may be ſaid of the divine Nature, that the Father is greater than it, as we have a little before demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated. We forbear to repeat that reaſon whereby we have confuted the Anſwer which is now adayes moſt received among the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; namely, that ſuch an Interpretation weakneth the force of Chriſts words, and renders them ineffectual to what he intended. For the ſame reaſon is alſo prevalent againſt this Interpretation: for if theſe words be ſo to be taken, as that nevertheleſs it may or rather ought to be underſtood, that Chriſt is the moſt high God; or hath in him the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64944:52"/> Nature of the moſt high God; they are not effectual to ſhew, that Chriſt muſt go away to the Father, and his Diſciples ought to rejoyce, that he would go away to the Father; as may be underſtood by what was formerly ſpoken. Furthermore, did Chriſt therefore call himſelf leſs than the Father, becauſe he is a middle Perſon between God and us; he would alwayes be leſs than the Father in that ſence, even after he aſcended into Heaven, and ſate at the right hand of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſince Chriſt is at this time a middle Perſon between us and God, in that he is a Prieſt, and our Advocate, interceding for us with the Father: for which cauſe the Adverſaries themſelves ſay, that he is now a Mediator. But Chriſt ſheweth by theſe words, that he, after he was gone away to the Father, ſhould be no longer leſs than he. Whence they themſelves, with whom we have to do, affirm, that Chriſt in thoſe words compareth his preſent ſtate with his heavenly Glory. For, as we already hinted before, becauſe the Son did yet want that Glory, to wit, Immortality, and ſublime Authority over all things, he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leſs than the Father; having attained the ſame, he is reputed no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger leſs than the Father. For neither is a moſt exact and altogether ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute equality here to be regarded. Wherefore Chriſt did not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay, that he was leſs than the Father, or the Father greater than he, becauſe he is a middle Perſon between us and God. I forbear to mention at this time, that they with whom we have to do, hold that Chriſt was in the ſame ſort even from the beginning of the world, a Mediator of God and Men. Whence it would follow, that his divine Perſon exiſting without the humane Nature, was already leſs than the Father, before that deſcent which they underſtand; neither do I here urge, that if Chriſt, becauſe he deſcended to us, that is, as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, aſſumed a humane Nature, became a middle Perſon between us and God, and conſequently leſs than the Father; it is neceſſary that both the Father and the holy Spirit became middle perſons between us and God, and leſs than themſelves. For neither could the Son or his divine Nature, aſſume the humane, but that the Nature of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the holy Spirit, and conſequently the very Father and holy Spirit, would together aſſume the ſame humane Nature, if that be true which the Adverſaries ſay, that thoſe three have one and the ſame numerical divine Nature.

                     <p>HEre the Adverſaries are not eaſily wont to fly to a diſtinction of Natures, partly becauſe they hold, that Chriſt before he was born of the Virgin, was ſent by the Father out of Heaven, yea, ſent to this very end, to be born of the Virgin, and aſſume a humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, partly becauſe they ſee, that to be ſent, and ſo to ſuſtain the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of an Embaſſadour, agreeth to none but a perſon, as ſuch. That I may not ſay, if Chriſt had been ſent only according to the humane Nature, it will follow, that he was alſo ſent by himſelf, or by his own divine Nature, when notwithſtanding he every where maketh another perſon, namely, the Father, to be the Author of his miſſion, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver maketh himſelf; yea, as we formerly<note n="*" place="margin">

Again, if the thing be ſo in divine matters, as they hold, it is inhumane; namely, that an equal may be ſent by an equal, yea, a greater by a leſs, nothing will hinder but that alſo the Father may be ſent by the Son, or holy Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which thwarteth the Opinion of the very Adverſaries, who deny that the Father may be ſent by the Son or holy Spirit, either apart or joyntly, though it is a wonder that they deny it, ſince they hold, that thoſe three Perſons are equal to one another in all things; ſo that there is no repugnancy if one of them may be ſent, that the reſt alſo may be ſent. But why do I ſay, that there is no repugnancy? ſince it cannot be, that one ſhould be ſent, but that the other muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be ſent, if ſo be they are of one Eſſence, and a Perſon cannot be ſent without the Eſſence. For if the Eſſence of the Father were ſent when Chriſt or the holy Spirit (that we may now together ſpeak of him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Beſides, from this anſwer of theirs, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that nothing hinders, but that God or Chriſt may be ſent by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and finally, by Men; namely, being drawn by prayers or other perſwaſions. But if all underſtand this to be moſt abſurd, let them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo acknowledge it to be moſt impoſſible, that Chriſt ſhould be equal to the Father in all things if he be ſent by him; for neither was there any cauſe why all ſhould judge either this or that, which in the firſt place was ſpoke of, to be abſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rd, than becauſe reaſon it ſelf hath taught all men, that the Sender in reſpect of that thing for which he decreeth the meſſage, is, as I may ſpeak with the Vulgar, the principal: but the Meſſenger is his Miniſter in the ſame thing. And withal, this hath alſo been underſtood, that the Father can by no means be inferiour to the Son or holy Spirit, who proceeds from him, &amp; have their Eſſence from him, or be Miniſter, much leſs the Miniſter of Men or Angels. As for the Inſtances therefore, or Examples alleaged to the contrary, here they ought to remember that which they themſelves are often wont to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate when there is no place for it; namely, that in this matter an Argument is ill drawn from humane things to divine. Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the diverſity is this, becauſe no man (unleſs perhaps you except ſovereign Kings, who are not themſelves wont to diſcharge Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) is ſo great, but that he may in a certain thing, be ſubjected, or ſubject himſelf to another, and ſo receive commands from him, and miniſter to him. Wherefore he alſo who is equal to another in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yea, ſuperiour, may be ſent by him, and diſcharge an Embaſſage
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64944:53"/> in his own name, and therein become inferiour to him, and in ſome buſineſs be ſubſervient to him as the principal. But the moſt high God cannot ſo be changed, as to become inferiour to any one in any thing, and to miniſter unto him: but he is alwayes ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our our to all, and all miniſter to him. Wherefore can he neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Office of an Embaſſadour.</p>

Again, If Chriſt be a perſon of ſupream Godhead, that limitation <hi>according to the humane Nature,</hi> hath no place in him, neither can it cauſe, that what agreeth to his humane Nature only, ſhould be ſimply affirmed of his Perſon. For a Perſon of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Divinity, is the very divine Nature.

Now the reaſon is ſo much the more to be preſſed, if it appear that thoſe things which are ſpoken of Chriſt, do indeed and properly agree to a Perſon only, ſuch as thoſe are which were mentioned. For theſe actions do not agree properly but to an intelligent Suppoſitum; that is, a Perſon as ſuch, eſpecially becauſe in reſpect of the Office which Chriſt ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Earth, he received Commands from the Father, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them, and is now called a Miniſter of the Sanctuary, as he is a Prieſt. But theſe Offices agree to none but a Perſon, as ſuch. Now that which doth not properly agree but to the Perſon of Chriſt, muſt needs agree to the Nature, which, with its Subſiſtence, compleateth his Perſon: But if that Nature be divine, the limitation of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries reſtraining ſuch Attributes to the humane Nature only, falleth to the ground. If it be a humane Nature, either there will be two Perſons in Chriſt, a divine and a humane, or that divine, which the Adverſaries do hold muſt be denyed, and a humane only, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Eſſence; but a divine, if you reſpect the Qualities, whereby it is endued by God, is to be acknowledged, which is the thing that we would have.

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>The Defence of the Argument.</head>
                     <p>THe anſwer that Chriſt prayed according to the humane Nature only, is ſufficiently refuted by what we have ſpoken before both in the 3d and 14th chapter, and alſo in the precedent one. Whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to add, if Chriſt, as this diſtinction ſuppoſeth, had had a divine Nature in him, there would have been no need that he ſhould fly to another Perſon, namely, the Father; as we read Chriſt very often did, and alſo with tears and ſtrong cryings. For what need is there to ask of another, and that with ſo great earneſtneſs, yea, further with tears, which you are able by your ſelf, and that by natural ſtrength underived from another at all times, moſt freely and eaſily to perform, yea, which you your ſelves have abſolutely decreed to perform, as certainly it is to be held of Chriſt if he were the moſt ſupream God, or moſt High. Some here reply, that it may be, that even he who may and will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſomething by himſelf, may beg it of another, to the end he may honour him in this behalf, and in a manner leave to him the glory of the benefit. And that it became Chriſt, as being the Son; in this ſort to honour the Father, and to ask of the Father by name, as of the Fountain, thoſe benefits which proceed from the whole Trinity. Which anſwer, firſt, taketh not away the difficulty. For they who
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64944:55"/> thus anſwer, either hold that ſome Prerogative agreeth to the Father above the Son, and ſo to the firſt Perſon of the Deity above the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, as ſuch, or elſe they hold it not. If they hold it, thoſe Perſons are not of the ſame numerical Eſſence, nor is the Son the ſupream and moſt high God; as we have already<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. <hi>1, 2.</hi> of this Section.</note> ſhewn before. If they hold it not, there is no cauſe why the Son ſhould rather ask ſomething of the Father, than of himſelf (if ſo be any one may ask any thing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) or without any prayers performed by himſelf. For what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is there, that in an abſolute equality, this honour ſhould rather be given unto the Father, and the glory of the deed attributed to him, than to the Son? Yea, Chriſt ſhould rather have taken heed, leſt by the example of his prayers, which he is found to have poured out to the Father only, he ſhould give occaſion unto others, to exhibit greater honour to the Father, than either to himſelf, or to the holy Spirit. For to Perſons altogether equal, equal honour is alſo due; and the Adverſaries themſelves contend, that thoſe three Perſons of Supream Divinity, which they hold, have equal honour and glory. But if you ſay, as indeed ſome do, that it was Chriſts modeſty to ask that of the Father, which of himſelf he could either aſſume to himſelf, or beſtow on others. Not to repeat thoſe things which have been already ſpoken, we may demand, to which Nature they think that modeſty is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed? If to the humane, it was not its modeſty, but judgement on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to prefer the Father before the Son, and to direct prayers rather to the more honourable. It is greater modeſty to make an addreſs to the inferiour, rather than to the Superiour. Or if you think the Perſons altogether equal, you ſhew no greater modeſty if you betake your ſelf, and convert your prayers, to one, than to the other. If they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe this modeſty to the divine Nature or Perſon (as we ſaid it was neceſſary, if this Perſon were divine, that is, if he were the very ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream God) they are very abſurd and injurious to the moſt high God. For Modeſty is a Vertue of Men and Angels, not of the moſt high God; It is, I ſay, a Vertue of ſuch a Nature, as may be exalted, and caſt down; not belonging to ſuch a nature as is not capable of exaltation and depreſſion. But if you dare to aſcribe modeſty to the moſt high God, as ſuch, there will be no cauſe why you ſhould ſo earneſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that Chriſt prayed to the Father not according to the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but according to the humane only. For it would not be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that Chriſt according to the divine Nature, did for modeſty ſake ſo debaſe himſelf before the Father, as to pray unto him for others, namely, Men, and obtain gifts for them, which he could by himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon them: which, how abſurd it is, every one perceiveth, and the Adverſaries themſelves ſufficiently intimate, that they ſee it, whilſt all that I know of, do in this Argument fly to the diſtinction of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                     <p>But furthermore, the manner of Chriſts prayers to the Father, chiefly expreſſed by the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in part intimated by the Writers of the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, doth at no hand admit that anſwer; for it argueth the want of Chriſt, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64944:55"/> neceſſity of praying, not modeſty only. This appeareth both from his great aſſiduity in praying, and alſo by his ſtrong crying and tears, and perplexity of mind, which ſhewed themſelves, as he prayed a little before his death. If you ſay it was neceſſity that Chriſt prayed, but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty that he rather prayed to the Father, than to himſelf, or his own divine Nature, not to rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ed, eſpecially in things pertaining to Chriſt himſelf, wherein notwithſtanding we ſee, that he uſed ſuch cryings, and tears, and contention of mind. For by what means, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſake, could the neceſſity drive the humane Nature of Chriſt to pray ſo ardently unto the Father, that he would not forſake it, or leave it deſtitute of his help, and that he would receive its ſpirit into his hands, and ſave it from death, if it had been joyned with an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveable tye to the divine Nature, which both could and would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, yea, could not chuſe but perform it? Do we think that the humane Nature of Chriſt was afraid, leſt that perſonal union ſhould be diſſolved. But the Adverſaries do not ſo much as permit any one to doubt of that; ſo far are they from believing that ſuch a thing could come into the mind of Chriſts humane Nature, or of the man Chriſt, or could it perhaps fear, leſt then the union remained entire, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding might perpetually abide in death, and ſo the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture remain to all eternity, perſonally united to a dead and bloodleſs corps? who would not tremble to think of this, ſince if you make a true eſtimate of the thing, this could not be done ſo much as for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It remaineth therefore, that Chriſt did not for modeſty, but for neceſſity, pray, and that to the Father, a different perſon from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; namely, becauſe he could not perform by himſelf that which he asked for himſelf, and could not beſtow that which he asked for others, but by power received from the Father, which by praying for others, he tacitly begged ſhould be given to himſelf. The firſt of theſe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated by the divine Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> chap. 5.8. whilſt, without expreſſing his proper name, he thus deſcribeth him, to whom Chriſt offered up prayers and ſupplications, with ſtrong crying and tears, namely, <hi>Who was able to ſave him from death, or deliver him from death.</hi> For by that deſcription<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would diſtinguiſh that Perſon from the Perſon of Chriſt, and withal aſſign the cauſe why he offered up pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers unto him, and finally intimate, what he did then ſo earneſtly beg for himſelf. But neither had he by this means diſtinguiſhed that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from Chriſt, if Chriſt had been as able to ſave himſelf from death, as the Father was to ſave him, ſince common things do not diſtinguiſh, but proper; neither had he brought a ſufficient reaſon why he made ſupplication unto him, with crying and tears, that he would deliver him from death.</p>

In which place, there is the ſame word that Chriſt uſeth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27. when he ſaith, <hi>All things are delivered unto me by my Father.</hi> Wherefore they ſay, that ſomething mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ht be delivered or given even to the moſt high God. Again, as Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 17.2, 5. deſireth of his Father to be glorified, and ſo that Glory ſhould be given to him, ſo alſo doth he there affirm, that he had glorified the Father, and hereafter would glorifie him.</p>
                     <p>But firſt we will ſpeak of ſuch a Giving as proceedeth from the grace and bounty of the Giver: for which cauſe we did in our Argument make uſe of this word <hi>beſtow.</hi> For ſuch is that Giving, whereby all things have been given to Chriſt by the Father. For Chriſt openly aſcribeth it to the love of the Father towards him, in the 3d and the 5th chapters of <hi>John,</hi> and chap. 17. he doth intreat for the Glory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned unto him. And God in the ſecond <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſaith to the Son, <hi>Ask of me, and I will give unto thee the Nations for thine inheritance, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 2. ſaith, there was <hi>bestowed on Chriſt, or given out of grace</hi> (for ſo the Greek word ſignifieth) <hi>a Name that is above every name.</hi> And the reaſon for which the power of quickning and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing Judgment was given unto Chriſt, namely, <hi>becauſe he is the Son of Man,</hi> doth ſufficiently argue, that it was ſuch a Giving as we have ſpoken of: which very thing is evident from that place of <hi>Daniel,</hi> chap. 7. and others like thereunto. But that the giving, whereby Chriſt ſhall deliver the Kingdom to God the Father, is not ſuch an one, all men do of themſelves eaſily perceive. For neither can it be imputed to the grace or bounty of Chriſt towards the Father, who needeth the bounty of none. For that is ſuch a delivery of the Kingdom, as, for example ſake, when a General, appointed by his King to manage a certain War, doth, when it is ended, lay down the Power that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto him, and reſtore it unto his King, who had hitherto exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed it by him, that if he be ſo pleaſed, he may hereafter exerciſe it by himſelf. And all this is no other than what Right it ſelf doth require, in as much as the Power was given unto him by the King, for the management of that War only. In like manner Chriſt, who hath received Royal Power from the Father, to ſubdue his and our enemies, and hitherto exerciſeth the ſame in the Fathers name, when all the enemies are ſubdued, ſhall yield it up to his Father; that is, ſo lay it down, that the Father may afterwards exerciſe it by himſelf, and, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>God may be all in all.</hi> From whence alſo ariſeth another reaſon of diverſity, in that we ſpeak of ſuch a Giving, as an
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64944:58"/> Inferiour cannot exerciſe towards a Superiour, ſuch as is the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of power and right on another, the giving of life, or the like things. But the delivery of the Kingdom may be incident to an Inferiour, in reſpect of a Superiour, yea, can be incident to none but ſuch. But every one doth eaſily perceive, how much that delivery, whereby Chriſt ſhall render the Kingdom to God the Father, doth differ from that, whereby the Father gave to Chriſt the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> and all Power in Heaven and Earth, and conſequently the other things. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when thoſe things were given to Chriſt by the Father, he was ſaid to have been made Lord and Chriſt. But who dare to ſay of the Father, that he, when Chriſt delivereth the Kingdom to him, ſhall then be made and conſtituted by him Lord and Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But further, let us grant that ſomething may be given to God, who is there that dare to ſay, that <hi>all things</hi> have been delivered to the moſt high God by another? That all Power in Heaven and Earth hath been given to him? as Chriſt affirmeth concerning himſelf. Would it agree to the Father, whom all grant to be the moſt high God, to ſpeak in this manner: I diſpoſe to you a Kingdom, as my Son hath diſpoſed unto me? Could it be ſaid, that it is given to the Father by another to have life in himſelf? that he liveth by another? Would this ſpeech be ſuitable to him, My Son, who gave me the Sheep, is greater than all? or this, Thine were they (Diſciples) O Son, and thou haſt given them unto me? Run over the reſt, and ſee whether you can without Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy apply them to the Father, or the moſt high God. Hence it eaſily appeareth, how frivolous that other thing is which they alleage out of <hi>John</hi> 17.2, 4. touching the glorifying of the Father. For there is as wide a difference between the glorifying of Chriſt which he begs of the Father, and the glorifying of the Father made by Chriſt on the Earth, as is between the Glory<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.2. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. <hi>John</hi> 12.26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4.</note> which God promiſeth to us, and will at length give by Chriſt, and that which we are ſaid to give or render unto God: between the bleſſing, whereby God bleſſeth us, and that whereby we bleſs God: between the praiſe and honour which he will ſometimes give to us, and that which we give to him: for the glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Father, which proceeded from Chriſt, was only the illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the divine Name, or the celebration, or manifeſtation of the Fathers Goodneſs, Power and Wiſdom; but that which Chriſt did beg, conſiſted in the conferring Immortality, and Sovereign Power. Which is manifeſt by it ſelf, and ſhall be ſhewn afterwards when we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the third Anſwer to our Argument. So that in the words of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2, 4. there is ſuch an elegant <hi>Antanaclaſis,</hi> as if ſome one of us ſhould ſay, Glorifie us O God, that we may glorifie thee: praiſe and honour us, that we may praiſe, and honour thee: Or, we have glorified thee on Earth, praiſed thee, honoured thee, finiſhed the work which thou haſt given us to do; wherefore glorifie us with thy ſelf with that glory which thou didſt deſign to us, before the world was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

Some
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64944:58"/> therefore anſwer, that all things were given to Chriſt from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by an eternal generation out of his Eſſence. Which anſwer like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſeemeth to ſtrike at the <hi>Major</hi> of our Argument, and ſo deny it to be univerſally true. For it is tacitly ſaid, that it is only true of the Father, but not of the Son, or alſo of the holy Spirit. But this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is not to be admitted, chiefly for two Reaſons. Firſt, Becauſe, as we<note n="†" place="margin">Chap. <hi>2, 3.</hi> of this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> already above hinted, it doth ſundry wayes imply a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for it maketh the ſame to be at once both eternal and not eternal; both the moſt high God, and not the moſt high God; the ſame in Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with the Father, and not the ſame; equal to him, and not equal. The one, while it attributeth to him the ſame Eſſence in number with the Father, and affirmeth that he exiſted from all eternity; the other, while it affirmeth, that he was generated out of the Eſſence of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and received all things of him, which he hath in reſpect of his Deity. Next, becauſe it evidently thwarteth very many of the places quoted by us. For ſome openly ſpeak of a thing which was done in time, and not from all eternity; as the place, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.32. and <hi>John</hi> 5.20, &amp;c. where alſo life is mentioned which the Father hath given to the Son to have in himſelf; that is, as moſt learned Interpreters do<note n="*" place="margin">John Calvin Wolfg Muſc. &amp; John Maldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat.</note> obſerve, a power and vertue of quickning, which many hold that he received by that eternal Generation from the Father. So alſo chap. 6.37. and 17.4. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.33, &amp;c. and chap. 3.13. and chap. 5.31. and 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 15.27. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.20. &amp; <hi>Phil</hi> 2.9, &amp;c. whereunto add all thoſe places which we have cited out of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> out of the Epiſtle of <hi>Peter,</hi> out of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> alſo out of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and out of <hi>Daniel.</hi> Some alſo expreſs ſuch a cauſe of that giving, as hath nothing common with that eternal Generation out of the Eſſence of God.<note n="†" place="margin">Chap. <hi>3.</hi> of this Section.</note> As that the Father loved the Son, <hi>John</hi> 3.35. and 5.20. and 17.24. which cauſe pertaineth alſo to the Life which the Father gave unto the Son, to have in himſelf; Or, that the Son, namely, of God, is the Son of Man, <hi>John</hi> 5.27. or that he was obedient to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther even to the death of the Croſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9. and that he glorified the Father on the Earth, and finiſhed the work which he had given him to do, <hi>John</hi> 17.4, 5. or that he did deſire and obtain it from the Father, <hi>ibid.</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. Let theſe things ſuffice to have been ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſecond Anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Now that we may come to thoſe Anſwers which endeavour by a diſtinction, to ſolve the Argument, they again are divers, For ſome ſeem to diſtinguiſh the word<note n="‖" place="margin">Third <hi>Anſwer</hi> and its <hi>Refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Give,</hi> and others that have the ſame force, others thoſe things which are ſaid to be given, others finally him to whom they are given, in reſpect of the divers Natures that are in him, one whereof is ſuch, that according to it, ſomething may be given to him, and conſequently all things have been given; the other ſuch, that according to it, nothing hath been given to him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt will ſay, that the word <hi>Give</hi> in the major Propoſition, is to be taken of a giving which is really made: but the <hi>Minor</hi> is to be underſtood only of ſuch a giving as is made declaratively: For they anſwer to the places wherewith we have confirmed our Aſſumption;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64944:59"/> eſpecially ſome of them, that they ought not to be underſtood, as if the Father did at a certain time really give to the Son, the things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned therein, but that he declared that the Son had them, or received them by that eternal Generation, cauſing that they ſhould be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all. Thus many take that Glory which Chriſt<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>John</hi> 17.1, 5, 23, 24.</note> begged of the Father; that alſo, that God<note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36.</note> made him Lord and Chriſt; that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that<note n="‖" place="margin">
                           <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9.</note> gave him a name which is above every name. But, firſt, they themſelves ſufficiently ſee, that this anſwer doth not agree to all the places which we have alleaged. But if the reſt be ſafe, our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would nevertheleſs conſiſt, although thoſe places which we have mentioned, or ſome others alſo, were to be taken in that manner as they would have. Again, There is no cauſe (unleſs they will alleage that very thing which we oppoſe by this Argument for a cauſe) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to depart from the propriety &amp; ſimplicity of the words; yea, there are mighty cauſes for which we muſt not depart from the ſame. For as to that Glory which Chriſt beggeth of the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. if Chriſt had it really in himſelf already, that which they ſay was to be manifeſted, namely, the Majeſty of that one God (for this they muſt of neceſſity underſtand by the glory which they contend, that he really had with the Father before the world was created) what need was there to pray the Father that he would glorifie him? for that would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes have been no leſs in the hands of Chriſt himſelf, than of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: nor would he leſs have glorified himſelf, than the Father him. Since it would be neceſſary that external works, yea, all ſhould be common to them; yea, Chriſt beggeth it of the Father as the reward of the performance of a work committed to him by the Father; as appeareth by the collation of ver. 4, 5. But beſides, that no reward can be given to the moſt high God, what reward is this of a work per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that he ſhould be acknowledged the ſupream God who is ſo? is not this very juſtly due unto God without any reſpect of any work? And no leſs to the Son than to the Father, or to the holy Spirit. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, how well they explain that, <hi>Father glorifie me with thy ſelf?</hi> for what is that <hi>with thy ſelf?</hi> Is it not manifeſt, that ſuch words are wont to be oppoſed, and are in this place oppoſed unto that which is done with men, or appeareth before them, as in the latter words it is tacit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed unto them <hi>with me?</hi> It is not therefore ſpoken of a thing which ought to be done with men, ſuch as would be that manifeſtation of Chriſts Glory which he really had from eternity, but which he had with God. What then? ought the Father to declare unto himſelf the Majeſty of the Son? had he not ſufficiently known it? And when he knew it not, ought he to declare it to himſelf, or elſe to the Angels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with him in Heaven? What? had not they ſufficiently known the Majeſty of the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity? had they not beheld it with their eyes? As to that place, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. where God is ſaid to have made Jeſus Lord and Chriſt, the words admit not ſuch an explication, for if we follow their explication, <hi>Peter</hi> muſt be thought to ſpeak thus; <hi>Therefore let all the Houſe of Iſrael aſſuredly know, that God hath declared him both Lord and Chriſt, even this Jeſus, whom ye have crucified.</hi> But
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64944:59"/> to whom hath he declared it? was it to Angels? Had not they yet known Chriſt to be that which he was, and had long ſince been? Was it to men? But <hi>Peter,</hi> and God did by him, in theſe very words, truly firſt declare that very thing to the <hi>Jews.</hi> Again, <hi>Peter</hi> deduceth theſe words from thoſe in the<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 110.1.</note> 
                        <hi>Pſalms, The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand.</hi> But in them Chriſt is bidden to reign, as <hi>Paul</hi> interpreteth it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. and is not only declared to reign. What doth the Father perhaps command, the Son himſelf to declare, that he reigneth, and hath alwayes reigned? But they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us, that Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 17. prayed the Father to do it, ſince he had in like manner already glorified him, and would hereafter glorifie him again. To this ſitting at the right hand of God, <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſeth the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering up of the<note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 24, &amp;c.</note> Kingdom, which certainly ſhall not conſiſt therein, in that Chriſt ſhall no longer declare that he reigneth; yea, if Chriſt be that one God, he will then declare unto us in Heaven, that he reigneth no leſs than the Father, ſince God ſhall be all in all. I omit other things which might be ſaid concerning theſe words of the Pſalmiſt. Finally, They who will have it, that God declared Jeſus Lord and Chriſt, either hold that he was Chriſt from eternity, or made ſuch at a certain time. He could not be from eternity, for to be Chriſt, is to be Anointed; which is not incident to the moſt high God, as he is ſuch; neither hath any one, as I know, dared to ſay ſo; but all ſay, that it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth to Chriſt as he is man. He was therefore at a certain time made Chriſt, and that by him whoſe Anointed he is ſaid to be, namely, God the Father. Why then go they about the buſh, and ſeek ſtarting holes? ſince they are notwithſtanding, forced to confe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s that he was ſometimes really, and not declaratively only made by God, Lord and Chriſt (for to be the Chriſt, is to be the Lord and King of God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) although they agree not with us about the time when it was done. For that is ſufficient for us here, that God hath already made him Lord and Chriſt. Although who is there, that if he could but<note n="‖" place="margin">That is, Obtain.</note> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate of himſelf, to lay aſide his prejudicate Opinion for a ſhort ſpace, would not ſee that this happened after the death and reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt. Since all the circumſtances of the place in hand, do lead, yea, drive us thither, that I may omit others like thereunto; amongſt which is that <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.</p>
                     <p>As to that place, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. neither doth it admit that explication: firſt, becauſe by thoſe words is explained the exceeding great reward of the debaſement and obedience of Chriſt performed to God, even with the ſufferance of the death of the Croſs; but could not be to declare who and how great he is, and alwayes was; that is, as the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries muſt of neceſſity affirm, to demonſtrate him to be the moſt high God; whereof we have ſpoken above when we treated of the place, <hi>John</hi> 17.5. Aagain, Chriſt was therefore among other things exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly exalted, and a name given unto him above every name, that the knees of all things in Heaven alſo might be bowed to him. But what need had the heavenly things of ſuch a declaration, that they might bend their knees to Chriſt, being the ſecond Perſon of the Deity,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64944:60"/> whom they had alwayes very well-known, and, as I may ſay, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held with their eyes, and did yet behold. But furthermore, the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of this place, partly with the two precedent ones, partly with other teſtimonies of the Scripture, which admit not that explication, and are very like unto this place, ſhew that the ſame is here alſo to be rejected. Finally, though we grant that thoſe places are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood only of the declaration of Chriſts Majeſty and Glory, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, it will from thence appear, that Chriſt is not the moſt high God. For otherwiſe why ſhould the declaration be attributed to the Father, and not to Chriſt himſelf? For could not, and would not Chriſt alwayes declare the ſame by himſelf? yea, he could not but declare it when the Father did declare it; as we have in this Chapter a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hinted. And thus far concerning the third Anſwer.</p>
                     <p>But as for them who endeavour to eſcape chiefly by diſtinguiſhing the things given to Chriſt, they again differ among themſelves. For ſome (which is the fourth<note n="*" place="margin">The 4th and 5th Anſwer and the Refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both.</note> Anſwer) when they read that all Power was given to Chriſt, that he was ſet at the right hand of God, that he was made Lord and Chriſt, and other ſuch like things, ſay this is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, not of the right of ruling, but of the act and exerciſe of Rule. Others<note n="*" place="margin">The 4th and 5th Anſwer and the Refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both.</note> and (which is the fifth Anſwer) grant that it is ſpoken alſo of the right of ruling, which Chriſt got to himſelf by his obedience, and death, as Mediator and Redeemer. But, firſt, the ſame may be ſaid of both anſwers, that was of the third preceding, namely, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this explication of thoſe places was admitted, yet our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be ſafe, whilſt the other places wherewith it is ſupported, and which refuſe that explication, remain ſafe. Again, as to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, thoſe places of the Scripture admit it not, for all power in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth denoteth not the act, or exerciſe, or rule; that is, the actions which proceed from the Regal Office; but this very right and plenary Authority to rule and govern. There is the ſame force of this ſitting at the right hand of God, or in the Throne of God, or in the Throne of <hi>David.</hi> For when any one is placed by another in the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Throne, or commanded to ſit, not only the exerciſe of rule, yea, not the exerciſe it ſelf is primarily given, as which doth properly depend on him that is placed on the Royal Throne; but the very Office, Power and Dignity is granted to him. In like manner one is not ſaid to be made Lord and Chriſt, or King, when he exerciſeth the rule which he by full right obtaineth, and actually poſſeſſeth, but when he is put into poſſeſſion thereof. Beſides, that we may together treat of the latter anſwer alſo, either Chriſt alwayes had a full right or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to reign, or elſe he had not. If he had not, how can he be the moſt high God? Can he be the moſt high God, who hath not alwayes a full right to rule? If he had, how was it given and beſtowed on him at a certain time by another; namely, by the Father, either that he might actually rule, or attain the right of ruling? How could ſuch an Empire be given to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m by the Father for a reward of his debaſement and obedience? as not only that place of <hi>John</hi> 17.4, 5. but alſo <hi>Phil.</hi> 29, &amp;c. and ſundry other places intimate, that it was given to him.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64944:60"/> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, 11, 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.26, 46, 47. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9, 10. and 12.2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. For what one already hath in his power, and what he alwayes poſſeſſed with moſt full right, that cannot be paid unto him for a reward, nor at all be given by another. For if any one ſay, that it may be that one ſhould obtain the ſame thing by a double, yea, a treble right and title; as if he to whom another is indebted, ſhould both by nature and by will, become his univerſal Heir, likewiſe that it may be, that he who already poſſeſſeth a thing, may have a new right to poſſeſs the ſame; We anſwer, if any one already poſſeſs any thing, and that by a full right, it can at no hand be ſaid, that it is then given to him by another, when he hath a new right to poſſeſs the ſame. For that which is mine, can no more be made mine, and therefore neither given by another. But further, who would ſay, that that thing is then beſtowed on him, and given of Grace? who would ſay, that it is then paid unto him for a reward? would you not laugh at him who ſhould affirm, that he did beſtow on thee, or appoint for thee a reward of thy labour, and conſequently pay unto thee in lieu of recompence, a thouſand Crowns which thou already poſſeſſeſt, and that by very good right? yea, though thou didſt not yet poſſeſs them, ſo they were by very good right due to thee, none would either beſtow them on thee, or appoint them for a reward of thy labour as, yet to be performed, and conſequently pay them in lieu of recompence. Wouldſt thou not juſtly laugh at thy debtor, who ſhould ſay, that he beſtowed on thee, or for ſome certain labour which thou haſt performed to him, pay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>th to thee in lieu of reward the money which thou hadſt lent him? How much leſs therefore could Power and Empire he beſtowed on Chriſt, and paid in lieu of reward if he had already perpetually obtained it by the greateſt and the fulleſt Right; although a new right to poſſeſs the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had accreued to him? Wherefore ſince all Power and Empire is ſaid to have been given, and beſtowed on Chriſt by another, ſince he is affirmed to have been made by God both Lord and Chriſt after his reſurrection. Finally, ſince he obtained this as the reward of his debaſement and obedience, it could not be that he did already poſſeſs it before, yea, nor ſo much as that, that he ſhould have a full right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that thing before he had performed that obedience; which if it be ſo; how can he be the moſt high God? Nor may any one here think, that that right of ruling which Chriſt hath as Mediator and Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is not contained in that Right and Power which the moſt high God hath of himſelf, and conſequently that it might be given by another unto Chriſt, although he were the moſt high God. For the Right and Power of the moſt high God, extendeth it ſelf to all things that are not in their nature unjuſt, but certainly that Empire is not unjuſt, which is attributed to Chriſt as Mediator and Redeemer. And what, I pray, is that Right of ruling? Is it not a right of preſcribing Laws un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and of executing them, a Right of remitting our ſins, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending us from our adverſaries, and enduing us with eternal felicity? But what? hath not the moſt high God a Right of doing all theſe things? How then did the Father give that Right to Chriſt? how doth
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64944:61"/> he exerciſe the ſame by him, if the moſt high God, hath it not of himſelf? Wherefore Chriſt alſo would have it of himſelf were he the moſt high God. Some other things which might be here ſpoken, ſhall be hereafter ſpoken in a more commodious place.</p>
                     <p>It remaineth that we examine the laſt, and moſt uſual Anſwer of all, to the places alleaged by us, and the Argument framed out of them, which conſiſteth in the diſtinction of the Natures of Chriſt. For they ſay commonly theſe things are ſpoken of Chriſt, according to the humane Nature,<note place="margin">The ſixth anſwer, and its refutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and not according to the divine. But, firſt, as we have before ſhewn chap. 14. it could not be ſimply affirmed, that all theſe things were given and beſtowed on Chriſt, that he was exalted, glorified, made Lord and Chriſt, if he had that divine Nature, according to which thoſe things could not be ſpoken of him. Since the very ſame things might ſimply be denyed of him, no leſs than they are ſimply affirmed of him in the fore-cited places. Add hereunto, that ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces contain in them a tacit Negation, and that a ſimple one; namely, that Chriſt hath not of himſelf thoſe things which are ſaid to have been given to him, for otherwiſe they would not be ſaid to be given to him. But in ſuch Negations, a diſtinction of Natures hath no place, as we have ſufficiently ſhewn before, eſpecially when we created on that place <hi>John</hi> 5 19. Again, To be, or become a King, Chriſt, Lord, to hold, or exerciſe Empire, and if there be any thing like to theſe, do primarily and properly agree to none but an intelligent Suppoſitum, or Perſon as ſuch. Wherefore it muſt be held, either of a very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, having ſupream Divinity, as ſuch, and conſequently of the very divine Nature, that all theſe things have been given to him by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or confeſt that Chriſt is not ſuch a perſon. Finally, If the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Supream God were in Chriſt, there would be no cauſe why it ſhould be ſaid, that all things were given to him by another perſon; namely, by the Father, and he made Lord and Chriſt, and nor rather by himſelf. For was the divine Nature of Chriſt in this behalf idle? did it not give all things to the humane Nature? Certainly the Adverſaries contend, that it did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ive them, and are forced to ſay ſo both by reaſon of that very ſtraight <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ion of either Nature which they hold, and alſo becauſe the Father could not give them. But that the Son ſhould withal give the ſame things, if he is of one Eſſence with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Why then is this attributed to the Father, and to him alone, not alſo to Chriſt? If you ſay, this is done becauſe of the Prerogative of the Father above the Son, you will hereby confeſs the Father, not the Son, to be the moſt high God. Howbeit, neither could a ſimple Prerogative, cauſe that this ſhould be ſo often attributed to the Father, and ſo openly, but never to the Son. For neither are they to be heard, who, when they reade in certain places, that God gave ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Chriſt, glorified him, exalted him, made him Lord, and Chriſt, underſtand the whole Trinity, or the divine Eſſence, that they may attribute to Chriſt the ſame action. For, firſt, ſince we ſo often read, either that it is expreſly written, that the Father did thoſe things; as to omit other places, it happeneth out of thoſe places which are cited
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64944:61"/> out of <hi>John,</hi> or that God glorified the Son, or gave ſomething to him, and ſince they themſelves confeſs, that the name of God in very many places, denoteth the Father only, why do they not confeſs, that he is underſtood in the places under conteſtation? doth not the very ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the places perſwade thereunto? Are not thoſe things which ſeem to be ſpoken more generally or confuſedly to be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of thoſe places which expreſs the ſame thing more ſpecially and diſtinctly, eſpecially ſince they are ſo many in number? Again, Is it not manifeſt, when the action of giving, exalting, glorifying, is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto God, a Perſon is underſtood (for ſuch actions are attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto none but Perſons) and ſuch an one as is diſtinct from Chriſt? For who even amongſt the Adverſaries themſelves, would endure him that ſhould thus ſpeak? The Son of God gave or beſtowed a name on Chriſt; the Son of God glorified Chriſt, made Jeſus Lord, certainly he that ſhould ſpeak ſo; would by the Adverſaries, and that deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, ſaid to ſavour of Neſtorianiſm, and attribute unto Chriſt two Perſons, namely, the Son of God and Chriſt. But the reaſon is the ſame, if you ſay that God performed thoſe things to Chriſt, and by the name of God, underſtand the Son. Nor are the Adverſaries igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thereof. But who will ſay, that the holy Spirit is underſtood? who is never found in the Scripture expreſly named God, much leſs by that name diſtinguiſhed from Chriſt, and preferred before him, is likewiſe no where read to have given any thing to Chriſt, or to have exalted him. To omit that the ſame queſtion will return which we urged concerning the Father, namely, why thoſe things ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the holy Spirit, rather than to the Son, if the Son were the moſt high God.</p>

                        <head>An Appendix of this Argument, wherein is taught, That Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was given to Chriſt of the Father.</head>
                        <p>BEfore we quite leave this Argument, we think fit to add this little Appendix thereunto, whereby our Opinion may be yet more confirmed. For it appeareth from the places which we have alleaged, that Divinity or Godhead was beſtowed on Chriſt, of the Father, and conſequently that he was made a God by the Father. From whence it alſo followeth, that Chriſt is not the moſt high God. For he was from all eternity of himſelf God, and did not at any time receive his Divinity from another, otherwiſe he would not be the moſt high God. Now that which we have ſaid, may be confirmed chiefly by two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments drawn from thoſe places which we have cited and diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is this, <hi>He that was made Lord by another, he, if he be a God,</hi> 
                           <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>1</label> 
                           <hi>was alſo made a God by another. But Jeſus, of whom it is certain, that, he is a God, was made Lord by God.</hi> 
                           <q>
                              <hi>Therefore he was alſo made a God by
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64944:62"/> him.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> (as they call it) or the Aſſumption is <hi>Peters. Acts</hi> 2.<note n="*" place="margin">ver. 36.</note> The <hi>Major</hi> is confirmed by this reaſon, becauſe if he were not made God by another, when notwithſtanding he is a God, neither could he be made a Lord by another. For he that is a God, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſo perfect a ſignification, as Chriſt is aſſerted to be a God, is likewiſe a Lord; and if he be a God of himſelf, he is alſo of himſelf a Lord, and therefore cannot any further be made a Lord by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The ſame may alſo be confirmed by this Reaſon; The Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſt is either the ſame with his Godhead, or different from it. If the ſame, certainly when he was made a Lord, he was alſo made a God. If different, it is either equal to his Godhead, or leſs. For Chriſt hath nothing greater than his Godhead. If equal (though they cannot ſpeak thus, who attribute to him the ſupream and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Godhead) there is the ſame reaſon thereof with his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; and there is no cauſe, why if he was made Lord, he was not alſo made a God. If leſs, it will in like manner follow, that he hath not of himſelf this priviledge of being a God. For if he have not of himſelf that which is leſs, much leſs that which is greater. In which place it is not to be omitted, that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in thoſe very words of <hi>Peter,</hi> inſtead of the word <hi>Lord,</hi> doth read the name of <hi>God;</hi> as if <hi>Peter</hi> had ſaid, <hi>And God hath made him God and Chriſt,</hi> this Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, &amp;c.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſecond Argument is this, He to whom that is given or granted, for which he ought to be worſhipped with divine Worſhip, hath alſo Godhead given and granted to him. <q>For neither is there any thing beſides Godhead for which we ought to worſhip any one with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, or cauſeth that any one is worthy of that worſhip. But we read, how that was given and granted unto Chriſt, for which he ought to be worſhipped with divine Worſhip, namely, all Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and a Name above every name: for ſo, as we have ſeen, Chriſt himſelf ſpeaketh, <hi>John</hi> 5.22, 23.</q> 
                           <hi>For neither doth the Father judge any one, but hath given all judgment to the Son, that all might honour the Son at they honour the Father: he that honoureth not the Son, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth not the Father that, ſent him.</hi> And <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 2.9. &amp;c. ſaith, <hi>Wherefore alſo God hath exceedingly exalted him, and given him a Name, which is above every name, that in the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven, and in the earth, and under the earth; and that every tongue might confeſs, that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the Glory of God, the Father.</hi> 
                           <q>Now that in both places it is ſpoken of the divine Honour &amp; Adoration which is due to Chriſt from all, both the thing it ſelf ſheweth, and all confeſs. But that this worſhip is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited unto him for all Judgment given him by the Father, for a Name given him above every name, the ſame Teſtimonies do clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew. The ſame may eaſily be proved likewiſe out of that place in <hi>Daniel,</hi> chap. 7.13. Where Chriſt is ſaid to have received from the Antient of dayes, that is, his Father, Power and Honour, and a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and it is added, that all Peoples, Tribes and Tongues ſhould
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64944:62"/> ſerve him, namely, for ſo great Power, and the Kingdom given to him. For who would not ſerve his King? Now this Service is not meant a civil one, as being to be given to one that was not an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King; but a religious and divine one, as to be exhibited to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and heavenly King. Why then do the greater part of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries deny, that Godhead was given or granted unto Chriſt? And indeed not a few both of the antient &amp; modern Interpreters of the Scripture,<note n="*" place="margin">See among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Corn. a Lapide</hi> in this place. Joh. <hi>1.1.</hi>
                              </note> affirm, that when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, there was given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, a Name above every name, that the name of a <hi>God</hi> is there underſtood, becauſe there is no other name extant beſides that which is above every name.</q> Though therein many are miſtaken, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that by <hi>Name,</hi> is meant the very Appellation or Title of a <hi>God.</hi> For how was this Appellation given him at length after his death, when <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that the Word or Speech was a God in the beginning; namely, of that thing whereof he ſpeaketh, which is the Goſpel. Add hereunto, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the reward which God gave to Chriſt, for ſo great debaſement and obedience to the very death of the Croſs. But what manner of reward is this, to give to any one a Title, if you give him not the thing deſigned by that Title? Doth the moſt bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and rich God, in this manner render rewards for ſo great Piety? ſuch a reward would be unbeſeeming even a Prince or other Potentate. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, when any one hath the thing it ſelf, and that moſt rightfully, there is no need to give or grant to him the name whereby that thing is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned; eſpecially when that thing hath a name already ſet and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, as here it cometh to paſs. If any one be indeed a King, and that very rightfully, there is no need to confer upon him the title of a King: ſince none can deny the ſame unto him, but wrongfully. But that is ſaid to be conferred, which might of right be denyed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt underſtand by that <hi>Name,</hi> not a Title, but Dignity or Power; as you have it in a like place, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.21. So that a Name above every name, is Dignity and Power higher than all other. For this is the proper cauſe of ſo great Worſhip and Honour. For as ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Worſhip is due to earthly and civil Power; and divine Worſhip is due to heavenly and divine: as alſo that place <hi>John</hi> 5.22. doth ſhew, where it is taught, that divine Honour is to be exhibited by all unto Chriſt for the Power of judging, which is the greateſt part of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, yea, contained in a manner all. Now if the thing be thus, why do the Adverſaries ſo inſult over us, for ſaying that Chriſt is a God by the Grace of God the Father, that Godhead was given to Chriſt by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he made and conſtituted a God by him? Why do they up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid us, ſaying that we have two Gods; the one (as ſome are not afraid to jeſt in ſo ſerious a matter) an old God, the other a young God? As if we had either two ſupream Gods, or to have one ſupream God, and another dependent on him, and ſubordinate to him, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scripture, which expreſly affirmeth that there are many Gods, and affirmeth in down-right terms, that we have one God the Father, of whom are all things, and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things; or as if the Father, becauſe he was God from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,

On which notwithſtanding, we will not here dwell long, partly becauſe we have above ſaid ſomething concerning them, when we cited thoſe places out of <hi>John,</hi> wherein ſomething is denyed of Chriſt, which could not be denyed of him, if he were the moſt high God, in the ſecond and third chapter of this Section; partly alſo, becauſe they are ſo nearly allyed to thoſe places immediately going before; wherein it is ſaid, that ſome dignity was given to Chriſt by God, and granted, or beſtowed on him, ſo that they are in a manner of the ſame purport with them.

Likewiſe chap. 14.10. where he ſaith, <hi>That the Father which abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in him, he doth the works.</hi> Of both which, enough hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. <hi>3.</hi> of this Section.</note> ſpoken. Hitherto belong thoſe words of Chriſt, which are likewiſe extant, chap. 5.36. <hi>I have greater teſtimony than that of John; the Works which the Father hath given me to do, the very works that I do, they hear witneſs of me, that the Father hath ſent me.</hi> And chap. 10.25. <hi>The works which I do in the name of my Father, they teſtifie of me.</hi> Now what is it to do them in the name of his Father, than to do them by the Power, Authority and Command of the Father? and the ſame chapter, ver. 37, 38. <hi>If I do not the Works of my Father, believe me not. But if I do, although you will not believe me, believe the Works, that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.</hi> And chap. 11.41. being about to raiſe <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he thus ſpeaketh, <hi>Father, I give thee thanks, becauſe thou haſt heard me. But I know that thou alwayes beareſt me, but for the Peoples ſake that ſtand about, I ſpeak it, that they may believe that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> From which place it appeareth, that Chriſt raiſed <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and did other the like Miracles, becauſe he was heard by the Father, and a Power to do them was alwayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to him, or being o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

I omit the end of thoſe Works clearly expreſt by Chriſt, namely, That men might believe, that he was ſent by the Father; and ſo, that the Father was in him, as in an holy Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, and moſt dear Son; and likewiſe that he was in the Father, or cloſely united unto him; as the like words in the ſame <hi>John,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See John</hi> 6.56. and 14.20. &amp; 15.4, 5. &amp; 17.21, 22, 23, 26 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.5, 6, 24, 26, 27, 28, &amp; 3.24. &amp; 4.12, 13, 15, 16. &amp; 5.20.</note> are elſewhere taken. But if Chriſt were the moſt high God, and had done Miracles by a Power that was altogether natural unto him, this ought not to have been the end of them, that men ſhould believe that he was ſent by another, but rather that they might underſtand, that he came of himſelf, and did in his own name give Precepts, and propoſe Promiſes unto all.</p>
                  <p>We have already before ſtopt the gap through which men fly to a diſtinction of Natures, inaſmuch as theſe things are ſimply, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limitation, uttered concerning Chriſt: which could not be done if he were that one God, becauſe the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>me things ſhould alſo be denyed of him without limitation. Again, becauſe thoſe operations proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree to the Suppoſitum or Perſon of Chriſt, as ſuch; not to a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64944:66"/> which is not a Perſon. Wherefore they ought either to confeſs, that the humane Nature is a Perſon, if they will underſtand thoſe things of it, and ſo are forced to deny, that Chriſt is a divine Perſon, and the moſt high God, or to affirm, that thoſe things are ſpoken of Chriſt, even us a divine Perſon, and the very moſt high God. Beſides, he ought not to aſcribe theſe things to another Perſon, but to another part of himſelf; that is, to his divine Nature, unleſs you will have it, to have been idle therein: But it was impoſſible for it to have been idle, whilſt the Father wrought, if both had one and the ſame nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Nature. To theſe places fetcht out of <hi>John,</hi> are to be added, thoſe words of <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 2.22 <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by Signs, Wonders and mighty works, which God did by him in the midſt of you, &amp;c.</hi> And thoſe of the ſame <hi>Peter,</hi> chap. 10.38. where he ſaith, <hi>How God anointed him</hi> (Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth) with the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Devil, becauſe God was with him.</hi> Which thing <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had before acknowledged whilſt he thus ſpeaketh unto Chriſt, <hi>We know that thou art come a Teacher from God; for none can do theſe things which thou doſt, unleſs God be with him,</hi> John 3.2. But if Chriſt were the moſt high God, neither would God be ſaid to do theſe things by him, nor ought <hi>Peter</hi> to alleage this reaſon, why Chriſt did Miracles, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe God was with him: but this becauſe he himſelf was God, or becauſe he had in him the divine Eſſence, or in what manner ſoever he pleaſed to expreſs the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>For that it cannot here be ſaid, that by the name of <hi>God,</hi> the divine Nature of Chriſt is underſtood, but the Father of Chriſt; may be ſhewn by the ſame Arguments which we made uſe of in the defence of the laſt Argument, when we treated of thoſe Teſtimonies, wherein God is ſaid to have given ſomething to Chriſt, or to have conferred ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon him: Likewiſe we have a little before excluded the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Natures.</p>
                  <p>But that we may not treat of the ſole. Miracles of Chriſt, let us add thoſe places of Scripture whereby is ſhewn, that Chriſt was not the firſt, but the ſecond and intermediate cauſe of the other actions alſo which he did, and which were moſt divine, and moſt of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned our Salvation. And this is underſtood out of thoſe places, wherein it is affirmed, <hi>That all things were done by him;</hi> as <hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>That all things were created in him;</hi> that is, <hi>by him.</hi> For that <hi>In</hi> is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Hebrew manner every where taken for <hi>by,</hi> is moſt notorious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. which is preſently explained in the ſame verſe, whilſt all things are, ſaid to have been created <hi>by him.</hi> For whereas the vulgar tranſlation doth there add, that all things are created <hi>in him;</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> hath it, <hi>for him,</hi> and ſignifieth the end. Thus a little after it is in the ſame place ſaid, that it pleaſed him, namely, God, <hi>by him to reconcile all things which are in Heaven and in Earth.</hi> Elſe where likewiſe, <hi>All things are ſaid to be by him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6. of which place we have before<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 2.</note> treated; where alſo we have ſhewn, that it ought not to be taken in that manner; as it is once and again ſaid of God himſelf, <hi>That all things
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64944:66"/> are by him.</hi> For that it is not ſo taken of God, as if ſome other who is the ſupream Cauſe of the work, did do ſomething by him; but ſimply, that he is the efficient Cauſe of all things, or that by his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Operation all things are brought to an iſſue. But that it is ſaid of Chriſt more than once, that ſome other, namely, God, whom eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one knoweth to be the ſupream Cauſe of Works, doth or did all things by Chriſt. For amongſt other things, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Who</hi> (God) <hi>created all things by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as the Greek Copies conſtantly read it, and the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> 1.2. when he had ſaid, that God <hi>in theſe laſt times ſpeak to us in the Son;</hi> that is, by the Son according to the Hebrewiſm a little before obſerved; he addeth, <hi>By whom alſo he made the Worlds,</hi> namely, that God who ſpake unto us by him. So alſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 18. it is ſaid <hi>That all things are of God, who hath reconciled us unto himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Elſewhere, <hi>That God hath given us the victory by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.57. <hi>That God hath poured the holy Spirit abundantly upon us by Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour,</hi> Tit. 3.5. <hi>That God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men (according to</hi> Pauls <hi>Goſpel) by Jeſus Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 2.16. To paſs by other-like pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from all which it appeareth, that Chriſt is not the moſt high God. For he is the firſt and higheſt Cauſe of all things which he doth, not the ſecond or intermediate: But thoſe places ſhew, that Chriſt is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate, not the firſt and ſupream Cauſe of thoſe thing which he doth; otherwiſe it could not be ſaid, that <hi>God doth all things by him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if any one ſay, that <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, that he gave to the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> commandments by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, or exhorteth them by Chriſt, although Chriſt ſeemeth not to have been the middle cauſe of that action in reſpect of <hi>Paul,</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> rather in reſpect of Chriſt, We anſwer, That that ſignification which is alſo otherwiſe rare in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, cannot there have any place, where God is ſaid to have done either all things, or ſomethings by Jeſus Chriſt, as that very thing we even now ſpeak by way of objection to our ſelves, doth teach. For in that manner that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he gave commandments, or exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the Lord Jeſus, none but an Inferiour can do ſomething by a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, for it ſignifieth, that he did or doth theſe things by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Lord Jeſus interpoſed, and that he ſupported his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and exhortations herewith. But God can do nothing by any one in this manner. It therefore remaineth, that the moſt uſual ſignification of the particle <hi>By,</hi> is there to be retained where God is ſaid to do ſomething by Chriſt; namely, that God be eſteemed the firſt and principal Agent, Chriſt the ſecond and intermediate one, which dependeth on him. Which is further confirmed by that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous place of <hi>Paul,</hi> which is extant, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. where the Apoſtle compriſeth all the benefits which God hath conferred upon us by Chriſt, whilſt he ſpeaketh thus: <hi>of him</hi> (namely, God) <hi>Ye are in Chriſt Jeſus, who hath been made unto us of God, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Redemption.</hi> You ſee that he is made not the prime Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64944:67"/> but the ſecond cauſe, and dependent on a former one, namely, God, in as much as he is expreſly ſaid, <hi>to be made unto us of God, Wiſdom, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption, and Freedom,</hi> which likewiſe was ſignified by the precedent words, wherein the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they were Chriſtians, are ſaid to be of God in Chriſt Jeſus, or by Chriſt Jeſus. There is a place like unto this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9, 10. where it is ſaid, that Chriſt being made perfect, was made the cauſe of eternal Salvation to all that obey him, being called of God an high Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedec.</hi> You ſee that he was made the cauſe of eternal Salvation, and that as he was called of God an high Prieſt. With this place agreeth that which we have formerly cited out of the <hi>Acts,</hi> chap. 5.31. where God is ſaid with his right hand to have exalted Chriſt to be a Prince and Saviour, to give Repentance unto Iſrael, and foregiveneſs of ſins. To theſe add thoſe places which ſpake of the effuſion of the holy Spirit made by Chriſt; which action is one of the moſt notable ones that pertaineth to the Salvation of mankind, and to omit the repetition of that place out of <hi>John,</hi> which we have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alleaged, when we diſcourſed of the Prayers that Chriſt poured out to the Father, chap. 14.16. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Advocate.</hi> And there is yet another place in the ſame <hi>John</hi> concerning the ſame thing afterwards, chap. 15.26. <hi>But when the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate is come, whom I will ſend unto you from the Father.</hi> Whence you ſee, that Chriſt not for himſelf, as from the prime Fountain, but from the Father would ſend, and conſequently did ſend the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; whom he alſo expreſly ſaith, <hi>doth proceed from the Father,</hi> making the Father the prime Cauſe of him, and himſelf the middle cauſe. Concerning the ſame thing, there is a notable place in the <hi>Acts,</hi> which we have formerly cited, chap. 2, 33. where immediately after the firſt and moſt illuſtrious effuſion of the holy Spirit upon the Diſciples of Chriſt, <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh thus, <hi>Therefore being exalted by the right hand of God, and having received the Promiſe of the holy Spirit from the Father, be poured out that which you now ſee and hear.</hi> Therefore, as Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf elſewhere ſpeaketh, he actually received from the Father the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, that had been before promiſed to him, and ſo poured him out upon the Apoſtles. Which thing doth ſignifie no other, than that the Father was the firſt Cauſe of that effuſion, and Chriſt the ſecond, wholly depending upon the Father therein. Whereby likewiſe it may be underſtood, why <hi>John,</hi> chap. 7.39. ſaid, that the holy Spirit was not yet given, becauſe Chriſt was not yet aſcended, namely, becauſe he could not give the holy Spirit till he was exalted by the right hand of God, and glorified. Whence Chriſt alſo himſelf ſaid, chap. 16.7. <hi>I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go away</hi> (namely, to the Father, and ſo be glorified) <hi>for unleſs I go away, the Advocate will not come unto you. But if I go away, I will ſend him unto you.</hi> Now how far diſtant theſe things are from that Opinion which maketh Chriſt the moſt high God, and ſo the firſt and higheſt Cauſe of all things and actions, not only we have already ſhewn, but every one may of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf eaſily perceive.</p>

                  <p>The diſtinction of Natures hath no more place here than in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer paſſages &amp; Arguments drawn from thence, both becauſe it would be neceſſary, that the ſame things ſhould be denyed of the ſame Chriſt for his divine Nature, which are here ſimply affirmed of him for his humane Nature; and alſo becauſe theſe places likewiſe contain in them a tacit Negation, and that a ſimple one; namely, that Chriſt did not thoſe things of himſelf, or was not the firſt cauſe of thoſe works, and finally, becauſe thoſe operations are not agreeable to any thing, but the Suppoſitum or Perſon of Chriſt as it is ſuch, and partly the places themſelves, manifeſtly intimate, partly the Adverſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves confeſs, that Chriſt is conſidered in them, either as a Mediator and Embaſſadour of God, or as a Prieſt, or as a King. And to ſum up all in a word, as a Saviour, and conſequently as a Perſon.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64944:68"/> now there was no cauſe of doubting, becauſe the Father was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually with him, and ſo ſuffered him not to err in judgment. But were Chriſt the moſt high God, <label type="milestone">

For is not the judgment of one perſon, who is the moſt high God, accompted as true if he be by himſelf, as if it be apparent that another perſon, which likewiſe is the moſt high God, is preſent with him? Or were they with whom Chriſt ſpake ſo ſtupid, as that if they had underſtood Chriſt to be the moſt high God, they would preſently have confeſſed, that his Judgment was moſt true, although they had heard or thought nothing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome other perſon, which was preſent with him as in other things, ſo alſo in judging.</p>

                     <head>The Defence of the Argument.</head>
                     <p>YOu will perhaps ſay, that Chriſt fitted his ſpeech to the Opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who believed him to be a mere man, and therefore that he could not take for granted that he was the moſt high God, but was forced to draw his Argument from a thing manifeſt unto them. But this Anſwer is of no worth. For firſt, If Chriſt would have taken that only for granted which the Jews believed concerning him, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought, nor could take that for granted which he here affirmeth of himſelf, eſpecially if the Opinion of the Adverſaries be right. For they did not yet believe, that God was his Father, which he here ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for granted. Nor did they yet believe that his Father, namely, God, had ſent him, and ſo was alſo with him. Again, The Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries cannot uſe this Anſwer, unleſs they will confeſs, that Chriſt did not therefore call God his Father, becauſe he was ſo generated out of his Eſſence, as that he was one God with him; for if for this cauſe he had called God his Father, he had already taken that for granted, which this anſwer contend he could not take. For what other thing would it be, to take for granted that God was his Father, than that he alſo was the moſt high God? But we manifeſtly ſee, that Chriſt here ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that God was his Father. Now if you reply, that Chriſt doth indeed ſuppoſe this, but implicitly and accutely, ſo that the Jews did not underſtand it, that will fall to the ground which our Adverſaries are wont to ſay; namely, that for Chriſt to call God his Father, and himſelf the Son of God, was ſo manifeſt an Argument for the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt out of the Eſſence of God, that even the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do underſtand it. And th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s they will have to be the cauſe why they charged him with the crime of Blaſphemy thereupon, and would have ſtoned him, and did at length crucifie him, in that he called God his Father, and himſelf the Son of God; namely, becauſe they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that he did by this means intimate, that he was begotten out
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64944:68"/> of the Eſſence of God, and ſo hath one Eſſence with him. For hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are wont to draw thoſe places in <hi>John,</hi> chap. 5.17, 18. and chap. 10.30 and chap. 19.7: and <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.63, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Some other will perhaps ſay, That Chriſt intended to ſay that very thing wich we deny; namely, that he was that one God with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For this was the cauſe why they affirmed, that he was not alone, but the Father was with him, and conſequently that he could not err in judging, becauſe the Father was joyned to him by unity of Eſſence. But, firſt, he had ſpoken too obſcurely, if he would have comprehended ſo great a matter in thoſe words. For who is there if any one ſay, I am not alone, but I and the Father, would underſtand his meaning to be that he is of one Eſſence with God? For if you ſay, that this is ſufficiently hinted by the word <hi>Father,</hi> it is to be noted, that the force of Chriſt words, or (as they ſpeak) the middle term of the principal Argument, conſiſteth not of the word <hi>Father,</hi> but in this, that the Father was preſent with Chriſt. But that God, or the Father ſhould be with any one, hath a far different meaning than to have one Eſſence with him. For it ſignifieth, according to the uſe of ſpeaking, very familiarly unto all, but chiefly to the Jews, that God is preſent with ſome one by his favour and aſſiſtance. Wherefore the Jews by this means would not have perceived the mind of Chriſt, and the force of the Argument. Beſides, if there is ſo great force in the word <hi>Father,</hi> why ſaid Chriſt, that his Father was with him? As if ſome one might imagine, that they whom he already underſtood to be of one Eſſence, might be parted aſunder, and the one be left from the other. Finally, that deſcription of the Father, that he ſent him, namely, Chriſt, is repugnant to that Opinion, partly becauſe it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unneceſſary that there ſhould be one Eſſence of him that ſendeth, another of him that is ſent by him: nor can he be the moſt high God, who is ſent by another, but inferiour to him; as hath formerly in its place been ſhewn; partly becauſe in this deſcription of the Father, the reaſon is plainly rendered, why Chriſt was not alone, but the Father was with him; namely, becauſe Chriſt was the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour of the Father, and that an extraordinary one. For God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes by his favour and aſſiſtance, preſent with all his Embaſſadours in all things, which their office doth any way require: and ſo much the more with Chriſt than with others, in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>at Chriſt was a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent one than they. But unleſs you will acknowledge t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>is, that deſcription of the Father will make nothing to the preſent matter. Whereas Chriſt is not wont to make uſe of idle deſcriptions, and ſuch as are not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The diſtinction of two Natures in Chriſt, if any one will here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, it is eaſily refuted by the ſame Reaſons that we have uſed in the Defence of the precedent Arguments; which accordingly a wiſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der changing, as they ſay, what is to be changed, may of himſelf tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>The Defence of the Argument.</head>
                     <p>THey whom we mentioned, here riſe up and ſay, That Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged this very cauſe; for he ſpake figuratively, and intimated more than he ſpaketh; namely, that he is the natural Son of God. But if you object, Why then did he not openly ſay, becauſe I am God? They anſwer, that Chriſt uſed the figure of inſinuation, accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in a manner neceſſary, for the perſons with whom he ſpake. <hi>For,</hi> ſay they, <hi>the Jews could not have endured it, if he had openly called himſelf God, or the Son of God. Wherefore he ſpake what was true, and what was neceſſary to the cauſe: but ſo ſpake, as that he might delude his Adverſaries with the ambiguity and obſcurity of his words.</hi> But theſe men have by this explication, deluded themſelves and others, but ſo did not Chriſt the Jews. They confeſs, and it is a plain caſe, that Chriſt doth by thoſe words intimate, that he came from the Father, came out of Heaven, and ſhall again go into Heaven to the Father. For who would make any doubt, that Chriſt intended here to ſignifie, what he elſewhere ſpeaketh in the ſame <hi>John, chap.</hi> 16.18. <hi>I went out from the Father, and came into the World. Again, I leave the Word, and go unto the Father.</hi> Which thing is more than once repeated in other, or the like words, with the ſame Writer. But ſuch words as theſe are ſo far from ſignifying that Chriſt is the moſt high God, that they imply the quite contrary. For if theſe words, <hi>I went out from the Father, and came into the World,</hi> be taken of a local motion, as they ſpake; that is, of a deſcent from Heaven to Earth, properly ſo called, as thoſe oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64944:69"/> ones, <hi>Again, I leave the World, and go to the Father,</hi> are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of a local departure from the Earth into the Heavens, they are not incident to the moſt high God. For he, as all confeſs, is not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of his place. But if you ſo take them as that they ſignifie, that Chriſt had God the Father, as the Author of his Embaſſy, to whom he ſhal return, as it may eaſily be underſtood out of the ver. 42. of the ſame chapter: neither doth this argue him to be the moſt high God, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inferiour to the moſt high God, and depending on him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a different Eſſence from him. But there is no other ſence of theſe words remaining. For if you ſay that Chriſt therefore came out from God, becauſe he was eternally begotten of his Eſſence, as they, againſt whom we chiefly diſpute, ſeem to hold, this is quite forreign to the place. For it appeareth manifeſtly enough, that the going of Chriſt forth from his Father, was joyned with his coming into the world, as his return to God was with his leaving of the world, and conſequently that the diſcourſe is of a thing that was done at a certain time, and not from all eternity; which is alſo manifeſt enough from the 42d verſe a little before quoted. And withal, it is likewiſe appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that this going forth from the Father, is ſuch a thing us may ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly be oppoſed to his return to the Father, and cannot co-exiſt therewith. But what oppoſition is there between eternal generation out of the Eſſence of the Father, and a return to the Father from the Earth into Heaven? Or why cannot that return to the Father, co-exiſt with that Generation, if it, as the Adverſaries muſt of neceſſity hold, doth as yet continue?</p>

For every one ſeeth if Chriſt alwayes did thoſe things that pleaſed the Father, that he alſo did nothing of himſelf or of his own accord, nor ſpake any thing beſides what the Father had taught him. But this latter Chriſt doth not ſuppoſe as manifeſt to the Jews, but affirmeth, that it ſhould then be known unto them, when t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now it is all one for the Father not to leave Chriſt, but to be preſent with him, and conſtantly to love Chriſt, and to be perpetually with him by his help and aſſiſtance. And that this which we have ſaid was the cauſe of the Fathers love towards Chriſt, and conſequently of the help which he gave him, is intimated by the words of Chriſt, which are extant afterwards, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Therefore the Father loveth me, becauſe I lay down my ſoul that I may receive it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi> For this Commandment, as he himſelf addeth in the following Verſe, he had received from the Father. And Chap. 15.10. <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you; continue in my love.

Again, this likewiſe taketh away the force of that anſwer, that notwithſtanding this, Chriſt ſhould rather have alleaged this for the reaſon why the Father was with him, and left him not alone, becauſe according to the divine nature to which the humane is perſonally united, he was the ſame God with the Father.</p>

                     <head>The Defence of the Argument.</head>
                     <p>HEre the Adverſaries again are wont to fly to their diſtinction of Natures in Chriſt, as to a ſacred Anchor, which notwitſtanding the Reader may obſerve, that we have<note n="*" place="margin">See cap. <hi>3.14, 16.</hi> of this Section.</note> before ſufficiently confuted. We repeat not all things that have been ſpoken; we only deſire that it ſhould here alſo be obſerved, that Chriſt is here likewiſe conſidered as a perſon; for he is conſidered as the head of the man, &amp; conſequently of every man, that is, as a Lord appointed to rule every man, even as the man alſo is the head of the woman. But Chriſt is ſuch, as he is a Perſon. Wherefore if the Adverſaries Opinion concerning Chriſt, is true, he, as a divine Perſon, and conſequently the moſt high God, muſt have a Head over him, which implieth a contradiction, and is the very thing which they endeavour to eſcape, who here uſe the diſtinction of Natures. Neither may any one here ſay, that in the former words indeed, where Chriſt is ſaid to be the Head of the man, he is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Perſon, but in the latter he is lookt upon only in reſpect of that Nature which is not a perſon.</p>
                     <p>For beſides that, this is affirmed without reaſon, it is diſproved by reaſon. Firſt, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>uſe it is certain that God is the Head of Chriſt, as he hath received from him Dominion and Empire over the man. But Chriſt received that Dominion as he is a Perſon. Why then is it not God made the head of Chriſt as he is here a perſon? Again, if you inquire the cauſe, why the Apoſtle, when he had aſſerted that Chriſt is the Head of the man, did likewiſe ſay afterwards, that God is the Head of Chriſt, you ſhall find this to be the chief, that he might not ſeem to leave God no further power over the man, becauſe Chriſt is his Head, or Lord and King: but rather that it might be underſtood, that God is alſo upon this very account the Head or Lord, or King of the man, becauſe Chriſt is the Head of every man, in as much as God is alſo the Head of Chriſt himſelf For as the woman is not therefore exempted from the Empire and Power of Chriſt, becauſe the man is her Head, in as much as Chriſt is alſo the Head and Lord of the man himſelf, ſo neither is the man exempted from the Power of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt is his Head: ſince God is alſo the Head of Chriſt himſelf.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64944:72"/> Moreover, the Apoſtle ſpake this to give us to underſtand, that if we bring any diſhonour to Chriſt, who is our Head, it will at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to God himſelf, who is again the Head of Chriſt. But neither of theſe Reaſons would be of any force, if God were not the Head of Chriſt, as he is the Head and Lord of the man. But if God be the Head of Chriſt, as he is our Lord, he is the Head of that perſon, as ſuch. Finally, ſuch a gradation ought not to be made, as to aſcend from the Man to Chriſt, from Chriſt to God, as a different perſon from him, if beſides the humane, there were another Nature in Chriſt, to which it did no leſs agree, to be his Head, than to a Perſon different from him, but mention was to be made of that Nature as well as of this. Now if any one will fly hither for refuge, as to ſay, that by the name of God the Father is not underſtood, but the whole Trinity, he muſt, at leaſt, in the firſt place alleage ſome paſſage, from whence it may manifeſtly appear, that God diſtinguiſhed from Chriſt, denoteth ſome other beſides the Father. For we can alleage innumerable ones, wherein even by the confeſſion of the Adverſaries themſelves, it deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth none but the Father, and it is otherwiſe apparent, that ſuch things as are like hereunto, are expreſly attributed to the Father in the holy Scripture. For it is all one to be ones Head, and to be ones God. But the latter is expreſly affirmed of the Father of Chriſt, as every one may perceive from theſe words of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 20.17. and thoſe of the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ:</hi> 1.17. Add hereunto, that the Reaſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is called the Head of Chriſt, do all agree to the Father. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they agree to any other, we have no aſſurance thereof: or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are aſſured, that they agree to no other; namely, becauſe he gave all Empire to Chriſt; becauſe he gave the Laws by which he ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and governeth us; and alſo becauſe he bringeth his will to an iſſue by his hands, and provides for his own<note n="*" place="margin">

But in the laſt place, thoſe Reaſons which evince that Chriſt is here conſidered as a Perſon, permit not the Trinity here to be underſtood by the name of God.

For <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſaid that <hi>we are Chriſts,</hi> again affirmeth, that <hi>Chriſts is Gods,</hi> leſt any one ſhould think, that becauſe we are Chriſts, we are no longer Gods, but rather that he might underſtand that we are Gods on this very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, inaſmuch as Chriſt himſelf, and conſequently all things that are his, are Gods. But if he be here conſidered as a Perſon, his Perſon is not a Perſon of the moſt high God. For that is not anothers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you will have alſo the divine Nature to be anothers, which they who here uſe the diſtinction of Natures, do by this very diſtinction endeavour to avoid. Beſides, if Chriſt were the moſt high God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had withal a humane Nature, yet could it not be ſaid, that he is more anothers than his own. But here he is ſimply ſaid to be Gods; namely, another Perſons, without making any mention that he is alſo his own, or that his humane Nature is his divine Natures. If there is any thing that belongeth to the fuller underſtanding of theſe Reaſons, it may be fetched from the defence of the precedent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THe third place is extant in the ſame Epiſtle, chap. 15. where it is ſaid, that Chriſt ſhall deliver the Kingdom unto God the Father, and be himſelf ſubject unto him, who hath put all things under his ſubjection. For thus he ſpeaketh, ver. 24, 25. <hi>Then cometh the end, when he ſhall deliver the Kingdom to God even the Father, when he ſhall aboliſh all Principallities, and Authority, and Force.

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64944:74"/> the firſt from the 24th verſe, the ſecond from the 28th verſe. For as for the firſt, <label type="milestone">

                        <hi>from</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 28.</note> we have before<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. <hi>18</hi> of this Section.</note> taught, when we ſpake of thoſe places wherein ſomething or all things are ſaid to have been delivered unto Chriſt by the Father, that ſuch a delivery of the Kingdom is here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as conſiſteth in the depoſing thereof, and the reſigning up the right which one had to reign, ſo that he afterwards manageth that Kingdom neither by himſelf, as before, nor by him to whom he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth up the Kingdom. In which manner a General appointed by a King to wage a certain war, doth when the war is ended, deliver his Power to the King. But the moſt high God neither doth, nor can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his Kingdom unto any one in this manner, unleſs you will ſay, that he withall ceaſeth to be the moſt high God. For if he delivereth the Kingdom unto any one, as he did heretofore to Chriſt, he doth not ſo deliver it, as that he ſtrippeth himſelf of the Kingdom, but only reigneth by him, as ſubordinate unto him, to whom he delivereth the Kingdom. After which ſort, a King wageth war by his Captains. And not to ſtray from the matter in hand, God is ſaid to judge the World by Chriſt, whom he hath made Judge. For when he is<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>John</hi> 5.22, 24.</note> ſaid to judge none, the meaning is that he judgeth none by himſelf, but by the Son, to whom he hath given all Judgment; for otherwiſe God is in ſeveral<note n="†" place="margin">

As for the latter Argument, which may be drawn out of the 28th verſe, it is evident that the moſt high God can become ſubject unto none.

Add hereunto, that in the latter place it is emphatically ſaid, <hi>the Son al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo himſelf</hi> ſhall become ſubject to him, who brought all things under his ſubjection. Now who would believe that <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſpake thus, conſidered Chriſt not according to that Nature, according to which he is the Son of God, but according to another? For neither
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64944:74" rendition="simple:additions"/> can any one ſay, that the name of the <hi>Son,</hi> is in this place put abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely without adding the name of <hi>God,</hi> ſo that alſo the Son of man may be underſtood. For the word <hi>Son</hi> is manifeſtly oppoſed to God <hi>the Father</hi> as its correlative, as they ſpeak in the Schools; neither is the word <hi>Son</hi> abſolutely uſed of Chriſt, ever meant otherwiſe, than as related to God as its correlative, and not to any man. To omit that the Emphaſis which is in thoſe two words, namely, <hi>alſo</hi> and <hi>himſelf,</hi> doth require that Chriſt ſhould be thought to be deſcribed in that manner, wherein he exceedeth a l the other things there mentioned, as being ſubject to him, and not wherein he is either equal, or inferiour to him, and that manner is that he be called the Son of <hi>God,</hi> and not the <hi>Son of Man.</hi> For in the firſt manner he is equal to Men, and inferiour to Angels. But as the <hi>Son of God,</hi> by way of excellency ſo called, he is ſuperiour unto Angels, as it is openly written, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.4, 5. Finally, if according to the humane Nature only, Chriſt ſhall deliver the Kingdom and become ſubject, but not according to the divine, why is it ſaid, that he ſhall deliver the Kingdom to the Father only, why that he ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>all become ſubject to him only, and not alſo to himſelf, or to his own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature? Why is it added that God may be all in all? why ſhould not Chriſt himſelf alſo be all in all? For neither may any one ſay, that there the divine Nature, and that even of Chriſt himſelf, is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſolutely meant. For it is both underſtood from the thing it ſelf, that ſome Perſon is deſigned, (for operation and the government of all things, is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to him) and that ſuch an one as is diſtinct from Chriſt, and all the foregoing words openly teach, that it is ſpoken of <hi>God the Father,</hi> who brought all things in ſubjection unto Chriſt, and placed him at his right hand; as we have elſewhere ſeen. Now whereas ſome except, that it is therefore ſaid, that Chriſt ſhall deliver the Kingdom to God the Father, becauſe he ſhall reſign thar Kingdom which he hath, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, not which he hath as God, this is alſo of no moment. For, firſt, we have already ſhewn<note n="*" place="margin">Chap <hi>18</hi> of this Section.</note> before, that if Chriſt were the moſt high God, ſuch a Kingdom could not be given to him, becauſe otherwiſe he would at the ſame time, have the ſame Empire both from himſelf, and not from himſelf, be therein ſubordinate to another &amp; not therein ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate. In a word, both the moſt high, &amp; not the moſt high. For we have taught, that ſuch a Kingdom conſidered by it ſelf is contained in that Power and Empire which the moſt high God hath of himſelf, For there is no act of that Empire, which doth not by it ſelf agree to the moſt high God. But if Chriſt, being the moſt high God, could not receive ſuch a Kingdom, neither can he deliver it to another, and depoſe it.

The diſtinction of Natures hath here no weight, partly becauſe we have already before excluded it with reaſons; partly becauſe they who uſe that anſwer, will have Chriſt according to both Natures, or the whole perſon of Chriſt to be the Mediator, and conſequently to have and adminiſter that Kingdom which agreeth unto him as Mediator.</p>

There are yet two things which exclude that exception. The firſt is, that no cauſe can be imagined why, if the Father had a Mediator, Chriſt ſhould not alſo have a Mediator, and that the ſame Mediator, if he be the moſt high, and conſequently the ſame God with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ather. For whether the will of the Father was to be declared unto men by a Mediator, or

                     </gap>e pacified; the ſame cauſe alike pertained unto Chriſt, and to the Father; if Chriſt alſo be the moſt high God, the ſame with the Father. The other is, becauſe for the Unity of Eſſence it cannot be, that any one ſhould be a Mediator of one Perſon, and not of the other. For whether one Perſon doth declare his will by ſome one, or whether the buſineſs be, that his will ſhould be bended to mercy by ſome one. It is impoſſible, but that the will of the other Perſons likewiſe which are of the ſame Eſſence, ſhould be declared or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We have taught, that ſome of the Adverſaries, whilſt they make Chriſt a Mediator according to the humane Nature, do indeed make the humane Nature a Perſon: And that others ſay, that the very divine Suppoſitum, or Perſon of Chriſt, diſchargeth the office of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator (but it cannot diſcharge it, unleſs the very divine Nature diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it) and finally, that others openly ſay, yea, contend, that Chriſt is a Mediator according to both Natures: of which their aſſertion, they alleage this Reaſon among others, which neither the other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries can reject, becauſe otherwiſe he could not ſatisfie the divine Juſtice, requiring an infinite price for our ſins; and this is either the only or chief ground of the Doctrine touching the Incarnation, as they term it, of the Son of God, the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity. From which it appeareth, that the Adverſaries cannot here fly to the diſtinction of Natures in Chriſt. Howbeit, in the mean time, how ill thoſe things which they ſay hang together, even this doth argue, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Paul</hi> when he had ſaid, that <hi>there is one God, and one Mediator of God and Men,</hi> being about to deſcribe him, ſaith not <hi>the God and Man Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but ſimply, <hi>the Man Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> but he ſhould have ſee ſpoken, if the Opinion of theſe men were true. For deſcriptions of Perſons, as we have often hinted, uſed by the ſacred Authors, are, as indeed they ought to be, ſuitable to the things that are ſpoken of. Wherefore if Chriſt had been a Mediator, both as God, and as Man, or according to both Natures, the Apoſtle, when he would deſcribe him, ought to have called him not only a Man, but alſo God, eſpecially ſince expreſs mention had been made both of God, and of Men, whoſe Mediator he is. And indeed the Adverſaris love ſo to ſpeak, when they explain their Opinion with their own words.</p>

Now although theſe things be figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively ſpoken of Chriſt, as we have elſewhere ſhewn, yet this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that theſe kinds of ſpeaking could by no means be applyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, if he were the firſt and the higheſt Cauſe of the remiſſion of ſins, and forgave them unto men of himſelf, by a power not received from another; that is, if he were the moſt high God.</p>

                     <head>The Defence of the Argument.</head>
                     <p>THe diſtinction of Natures hath here no more place or ſtrength, than either in other places above, or in the precedent Chapter, where the Office of a Mediator is handled, eſpecially becauſe the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries place the Office of Mediator, which agreeth unto Chriſt in his Prieſthood chiefly. Wherefore not to repeat other things, we only ſay thus much. If Chriſt, beſides the humane Nature, had alſo a divine one, it would be neceſſary, that he no leſs than the Father,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64944:76"/> ſhould have an high Prieſt, and this Prieſt be himſelf: ſince neither any cauſe can be imagined, nor can it any way be: that the Father ſhould have a Prieſt, and Chriſt not have one, if he be God no leſs than the Father, yea, the ſame God in number with him, as may appear from thoſe things which we before ſpake concerning the title of a Mediator. But where is even the leaſt hint in the holy Scripture, whereby it may appear, that Chriſt hath an high Prieſt as well as the Father? Who ſeeth not, that it is very abſurd, to hold that the Perſon of Chriſt, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth to himſelf? wherefore the Prieſthood of Chriſt is utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the divine Nature, which is held to be in him.</p>

                        <hi>The nine and twentieth Argument,</hi> That Chriſt was raiſed up by the Father.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe ſixth Argument of this kind, may be drawn from the places wherein Chriſt is ſaid to have been raiſed by another, namely, his Father; which reaſon is ſo much the more to be urged, becauſe the contrary thereof is urged by the Adverſaries. For they ſay, Chriſt raiſed himſelf, and by this means clearly demonſtrated, that he was the Son of God, begotten out of his Eſſence, and conſequently the moſt high God. But this Argument partly falls to the ground by it ſelf, in that it is grounded on a falſe Suppoſition, as we will by and by demonſtrate, partly is weakned by another erroneous Oppinion of the ſame Adverſaries. For they hold that the Soul or Spirit of Chriſt, which they alſo hold concerning the ſpirits of other men, after he was dead, did notwithſtanding perform ſuch actions as agree to none but Subſtances, that are actually alive, and underſtand by themſelves. Some ſay that it went down into Hell, or Purgatory, and brought the Souls of the Fathers out of, I know not what, Priſon, or <hi>Limbus.</hi> But if the Soul of Chriſt, even during his death, did exerciſe ſuch actions, what hinders but that the ſame Soul, entring into his own Body, and former habitation, ſhould again unite it unto it ſelf, and by divine Power raiſe it up? For could the Soul of Chriſt, furniſht with divine Power, do leſs than his whole humanity when he lived, perform by the ſame divine Power? could it do leſs, than (for example ſake) ſome one of the Apoſtles, to whom Chriſt ſometimes gave the power of raiſing the<note n="*" place="margin">

For if Chriſt were the moſt high God, his raiſing ſhould be aſcribed to himſelf, as the true and chief Author. But it is not attributed to him, but to the Father, as the true and chief
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64944:77"/> Author thereof; yea, it is very openly ſignified, that Chriſt, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">That Chriſt was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up by the Father.</note> did not raiſe himſelf. Wherefore he is not the moſt high God. The truth of the <hi>Major,</hi> as they call it, is manifeſt enough. For none doubteth, if Chriſt be the moſt high God, that he did alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether raiſe himſelf, and that it was moſt ſuitable, that he ſhould raiſe himſelf. For ſince it follows from that Opinion, that the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, according to which Chriſt dyed, was perſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>y united to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, it could at no hand be, that the humane Nature ſhould perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally abide in death; and conſequently, in as much as that union, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Opinion, can never be diſſolved, that a dead corps ſhould in an indiſſoluble and eternal tye, be united to the divine Nature. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, if the humane Nature were to be raiſed, by whom rather was it to be raiſed, than by the divine Nature of the ſame Chriſt, which both could of it ſelf very eaſily perform it, and by reaſon of that moſt ſtrict union, did owe this benefit unto the Nature that was joyned unto it? Wherefore whether you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ability of performing it, the divine Nature of Chriſt would have been the prime cauſe of that work; for the Office of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, it would have chiefly lain on that Nature. How then would not Chriſt have been the true and chief Author of his own Reſurrection? As for the <hi>Minor,</hi> there are ſo many and ſo clear Teſtimonies of the holy Scripture, which make the Father the true and chief Author of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and not Chriſt himſelf, yea, very openly take away this work from Chriſt (though even the thing it ſelf, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his death, doth ſufficiently take it away) that it is a wonder, that any one ſhould doubt of it. For, firſt, in certain places it is openly ſaid, that the Father raiſed Chriſt, or that God raiſed his Son. But who is that God, whoſe Son Chriſt is, but the Father? The former is recorded by <hi>Paul,</hi> in the beginning of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> whilſt he ſpeketh thus, <hi>Paul an Apoſtle not from men, nor by man, but by Jeſus Christ, and God the Father that raiſed him up from the dead.</hi> The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is affirmed by <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 3. <hi>ult. To you God having raiſed up his Son, firſt ſent him bleſſing you.</hi> And <hi>Paul,</hi> chap. 13.33. doth indeed aſſert the ſame, whilſt he ſaith, <hi>And we declare unto you the Promiſe which was made unto our Fathers, that God hath fulfilled it unto us their Children, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving raiſed up Jeſus, as it is alſo written in the ſecond Pſalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. Now that he raiſed him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, thus he ſaid, &amp;c.</hi> From which words it appeareth, that he who ſaid unto Chriſt, thou art my Son, this day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> begot thee, which indeed is no other, than the Father, raiſed him from the dead. The ſame Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>Ye turned to God from Idols, to ſerve the true and living God, and is expect his Son out of Heaven, whom he raiſed from the dead, even Jeſus, who delivereth us from the Wrath to come.</hi> Where in like manner God is ſaid, to have raiſed his Son from the dead.</p>
                  <p>To theſe are added very many other places, wherein it is ſimply written, that God raiſed Chriſt; of which number we will here ſet
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64944:77"/> down only one or two, with the words at large, contenting our ſelves to quote the reſt. Thus therefore ſpeaketh <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 2.24. <hi>Whom</hi> (Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth) God raiſed up, having looſed the Throws of Hell, in that it was impoſſible that he ſhould be held by it. For David faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, I ſaw the Lord alwayes before me, becauſe he is at my right hand, that I may not be moved. Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoyceth. Moreover, alſo my fleſh ſhall reſt in hope. For thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell, nor ſuffer thine holy One to ſee corruption.</hi> And a little after, ver. 32. <hi>This Jeſus hath God raiſed up, whereof we are all witneſſes.</hi> See alſo what the ſame <hi>Peter</hi> faith afterwards, chap. 3.15. (which verſe compare with the 13th) and 4.10. and 5.30. and 10.40. and <hi>Paul,</hi> chap. 7.31. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.24. and 8.11. and 10.19. and alſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. and 15.15. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.14. and 13.4. But there is amongſt others a notable place in the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.9, 20. where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things he wiſheth to them, <hi>That they might know what is the exceeding greatneſs of his power</hi> (namely, whom he had, ver. 17. called <hi>the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of Glory) towards us, who believe according to the working of his mighty Power which he wrought in Chriſt, having raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand in heavenly places, &amp;c.</hi> And likewiſe thoſe words which we read chap. 2.5. and thoſe that are like unto them, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12, 13. Add alſo thoſe of the divine Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> chap. 13.24. and thoſe of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21.</p>
                  <p>We mention not thoſe Teſtimonies, which indeed are not few, wherein it is ſimply affirmed, that Chriſt was raiſed from the dead, which being ſo often repeated, doth altogether ſignifie, that he was raiſed by another; as alſo the circumſtances of ſome places, do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimate. See amongſt others, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.4, 12, &amp;c. where that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking is ſeven times uſed; and afterwards, ver. 15. it is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted, that God did it, and the Reſurrection of Chriſt is made the pattern of our reſurrection, which alſo happeneth elſewhere.</p>

                     <head>A more full Confirmation and Defence of the Argument.</head>
                     <p>YOu will ſay, that although Chriſt is ſaid to have been raiſed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet it followeth not that he was not raiſed by himſelf, in as much as the ſame action may proceed from many cauſes, and thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual among themſelves.

                     <p>But the firſt is not to be admitted for three cauſes chiefly.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, becauſe that at leaſt followeth from thoſe places which we have alleaged, That Chriſt is not the principal cauſe of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. For why ſhould the raiſing of him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <note place="margin">That Chriſt was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up by the Father.</note> namely the Father, and not rather to Chriſt himſelf? But even this thing alone might here be ſufficient for us to ſhew that Chriſt is not the moſt high God. For we have before ſhewn that he, if he were the moſt high God, would altogether be the principal Author of his own Reſurrection. Another cauſe is, becauſe the holy Scripture doth ſo attibute the raiſing of Chriſt to God the Father, that it doth not obſcurely, yea, very openly intimate, that the ſame action doth not indeed, agree to Chriſt himſelf. Firſt, becauſe if Chriſt had raiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the dead, and that by ſuch a power as was natural and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proper unto him, it ought to have been mentioned at leaſt in ſome of thoſe teſtimonies which we have alleaged; and to omit other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, this ought chiefly to be done, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9, 10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4.

                        </gap>ning both which things, ſee what we have formerly ſaid. Finally, that place, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19, 20. may be added, which we have formerly alleaged, where it is ſhewn, how great Power, how great Might God the Father did put forth when he raiſed Chriſt from the dead, and ſet him at his right hand in the Heavens. But what need would there have been of ſo great Power, or how could it at all have been employed by God the Father, if Chriſt had raiſed himſelf by a Power altogether proper and natural to him? Now if you ſay, that the ſame Power did alſo belong to Chriſt, as being common to the Father with the Son, there can no cauſe be alleaged, why it ſhould he ſaid to be put forth rather by the Father, than by Chriſt, in as much as we have already ſhewn that the contrary ought rather to be done.</p>
                     <p>The third cauſe wherefore that firſt exception ought to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of no weight, is this, namely, that ſuch a ſence doth exceedingly weaken <hi>Pauls</hi> Argument, whereby from the Reſurrection of Chriſt, he aſſerteth the truth of our reſurrection (as he chiefly doth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.11, &amp;c) and ſo throweth down the ſtrongeſt prop of our hope. For <hi>Paul</hi> doth thence ſhew, that we ſhall ariſe becauſe Chriſt aroſe: B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t if Chriſt raiſed himſelf from the dead by a power that was inbred, and altogether natural to him, and could not but raiſe himſelf, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is of no force. For how followeth it, if Chriſt raiſed himſelf by a power that was proper and altogether natural, and could not but raiſe himſelf, that we alſo, who are altogether diſtitute of that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and whom our nature doth not vindicate from eternal death, ſhall aſſuredly riſe?</p>
                     <p>There is now ſcarce any need to ſpeak of the latter exception, which
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64944:79" rendition="simple:additions"/> is, that by the name of <hi>God,</hi> who is ſaid to have raiſed Chriſt, either the whole Trinity, wherein Chriſt alſo is contained, or the divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, which was no leſs in Chriſt, than in the Father, may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. For we have brought Arguments even out of thoſe places, where the Adverſaries themſelves dare not apply that exception, wherein is ſhewn that Chriſt did not raiſe himſelf from the dead, the contrary whereof is required by that exception. But furthermore, who doth not underſtand, that when God, or he that raiſed Jeſus from the dead, is diſtinguiſhed from Chriſt, a perſon diſtinct from Chriſt, is underſtood, which is in this place ſufficient for us? That a perſon is underſtood, is intimated by the name <hi>God,</hi> which we have<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. <hi>1.</hi> of this Section.</note> before ſhewn to be proper to a Perſon, and alſo by the action of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, which agreeth to nothing but a Perſon; but that one Perſon is underſtood the very word <hi>God,</hi> as alſo that deſcription, <hi>He that raiſed Jeſus Chriſt from the dead,</hi> being uttered in the ſingular number, doth manifeſt. For neither is the word <hi>God</hi> a collective, neither is that expreſſion, wherein mention is made of him, who raiſed Chriſt from the dead, general and common, but proper and ſingular, but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between Chriſt, and him that raiſed Chriſt from the dead, is manifeſt from the very places. Nor as we have elſe where hinted, would he eſcape the Tax of <hi>Neſtorianiſm,</hi> who by the word <hi>God,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Chriſt himſelf by name,<note place="margin">Chap <hi>18.</hi> of this Section.</note> ſhould ſay that he raiſed Chriſt, or did any like thing about him, for it would be all one as if he ſhould ſay, the Son of God raiſed Chriſt. But what need more words? When the very Scripture explaineth it ſelf, for what it in one place attributeth to God ſimply named, it elſewhere openly attributeth to the Father, either expreſſing the very name of the Father, or deſcribing him, whom God raiſed by the appellation of his Son. If therefore there were any obſcurity, or ambiguity in thoſe places, wherein the raiſing of Chriſt is ſimply attributed unto <hi>God,</hi> without the addition of any other note, implying that it was ſpoken of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet would the other places ſhew that they are to be underſtood of the Father. For the obſcure paſſages are to be explained by the plain ones, &amp; the confuſed &amp; ambiguous paſſages, by the diſtinct ones. But there is no ambiguity, no obſcurity in the word <hi>God,</hi> ſince there can no place of the Scripture be alleaged, where the name <hi>God</hi> put ſubjectively, and alſo diſtinguiſhed from Chriſt, both which happen in theſe Teſtimonies, is taken of any other but the Father.</p>
                     <p>Now whereas certain Teſtimonies of the Scripture are alleaged, wherein the raiſing of Chriſt ſeemeth to be attributed to himſelf, as that he himſelf ſaid, that he would in three dayes raiſe up the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, namely, of his Body, <hi>John</hi> 2.20, 21. and that he had power both to lay down his ſoul, and to take or receive the ſame again; for ſo the greek word may indifferently be rendered, <hi>John</hi> 10.18. Theſe paſſages evince no other than that Chriſt was the cauſe of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and that it was ſo put in his hands, as I may ſay, that it could be taken away from him, and interrupted by none. After which
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64944:79"/> manner the ſame Chriſt ſaith in <hi>Luke, That he that ſhall loſe his Soul, ſhall find it,</hi> chap. 9.24, or quicken it, chap. 17.33. And <hi>John</hi> ſaith of them who believed in Chriſt, and ſo are born of God, that the word, namely, Chriſt, <hi>Gave them Power to become the Sons of God;</hi> that is, to become immortal, <hi>John</hi> 1.13. For othrewiſe ſo few Teſtimonies, whereof the firſt, as every one ſeeth, is altogether figurative, ought at no hand to be oppoſed to ſo many and ſo evident Teſtimonies and Reaſons drawn from thence, wherewith it is evinced, that this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is properly to be attributed, not to Chriſt, but to the Father. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more might be ſaid of theſe two places, which are alleaged to the contrary, but it is not now our intention and work to confute the Arguments of the Adverſaries, but with Arguments to aſſert our own Opinion. Wherefore let it now ſuffice, to have touched theſe places.</p>
                     <p>We Meddle not here with the exception of two Natures in Chriſt, for the intelligent Reader, if he ſhall conſider both our Argument, or Arguments rather, and alſo what we have ſpoken of that diſtinction in the former chapters, will eaſily underſtand that it cannot here have place.</p>

                        <hi>The thirtieth Argument,</hi> That Chriſt is called the Image of the inviſible God.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe laſt Argument of this kind ſhall be this, that Chriſt is called the <hi>Image of the inviſible God,</hi> Col. 1.15. which is in ſome part alſo ſaid, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. where Chriſt is in like manner ſaid to be <hi>the Image of God;</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. where he is ſaid to be the <hi>Figure of the Subſtance, or Charecter of the Perſon of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chap. <hi>1.</hi> of this Section.</note> Now we will not here uſe that Reaſon which we have already elſewhere, namely, that Chriſt is by this means openly diſtinguiſhed from God, that is, the moſt high God: but another Reaſon, and that twofold, the former whereof is common to all the alleaged places; the latter more proper to the place, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. For, firſt, no Image is of the ſame Eſſence in number with that whereof it is the Image, otherwiſe it would be the Image of it ſelf. Wherfore ſince Chriſt is the Image of God, he cannot be the ſame Subſtance in number with God, and conſequently not be God, namely, the moſt high God. There is the ſame force, when he is ſaid to be the Figure of the Subſtance of God, or Charecter of his Perſon. Again, If Chriſt be the <hi>Image of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible God,</hi> he himſelf muſt not be inviſible, and conſequently not the moſt high God. For he is inviſible, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17.<note place="margin">

                     <note place="margin">That Chriſt is the Image of God.</note> we may contemplate and know God, as other learned men alſo have obſerved, and left in writing.

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>The Defence of the Argument.</head>
                     <p>HEre, for as much as the greateſt part contend, that Chriſt was the Image of God from all Eternity, not according to the humane Nature, but the divine: therefore that they may ſolve our firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are wont to fly not to the diſtinction of Natures in Chriſt, but to the diſtinction of divers Perſons in one Deity. For they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that the ſecond Perſon of the Divinity, is the Image of the firſt; that is, the Son the Image of the Father, becauſe the Son in reſpect of Eſſence, is moſt like to the Father, as being begotten out of his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. But they deny that it doth thence follow, that the Son will be the Image of himſelf, becauſe though he be of the ſame Eſſence with the Father, yet he differeth from him in Perſon. As to the latter Reaſon, they will perhaps ſay, that the ſame Son, although according to the divine Nature he be God, equally inviſible with the Father, yet having aſſumed a humane Nature, he became viſible, and was ſeen by men. But theſe anſwers do not at all take away the difficulty. For as to the former, firſt of all, a Perſon is in vain diſtinguiſhed from his own Eſſence; in as much as every own is the ſame with his own Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Wherefore if the Perſon of the Son be the Image of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Father, the Eſſence alſo of the Son will be the Image of the Fathers Eſſence; and conſequently either both muſt have an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence different in number, or the ſame Perſon or Eſſence, will be the Image of it ſelf. Add hereunto, that they themſelves, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hinted, do contend, that the Son in reſpect of Eſſence, is moſt like unto the Father, and conſequently his Image; wherefore the Son muſt in reſpect of Eſſence, be diſtinct in number from the Father. For an Image, as it is an Image, doth differ in number from that whoſe Image it is, and one like from another For theſe are relatives, and conſequently oppoſites, but oppoſites, as ſuch, muſt at leaſt differ in number; nor can you ſay, that one is ſometimes ſaid to be like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For in ſuch a kind of ſpeech, reſpect is had to a different time, in reference to which, the ſame is compared with it ſelf: but we here ſpeak of like things, having no regard to a different time, but to the ſame. To omit that the Adverſaries themſelves, hold that the Son ought really to differ from the Father, that he may be the Image of the Father, but this would make nothing to the purpoſe, did they not really differ as the one is the Image of the other, if therefore the Son in reſpect of Eſſence, be the Image of the Father, the one muſt differ from the other in reſpect of Eſſence.</p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:64944:80"/>
                     <p>As to the latter exception, which alſo ſtriketh at our latter Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it will effect nothing, unleſs you ſay, that Chriſt is the Image of God according to the humane Nature, wherein he is or was viſible, which the greateſt part do not admit, for they, as we have ſaid, hold Chriſt to be the Image of God, as he was begotten out of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Father, and conſequently hath the ſame Subſtance with him, which agreeth not to him according to the humane Nature; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt firſt renounce this Opinion, before they make uſe of that Anſwer; for neither can they ſay, that there is no need, that Chriſt as he is an Image, ſhould be viſible, it being ſufficient that he is or was by any means viſible. For if it were thus, the word <hi>inviſible</hi> added to the name of <hi>God,</hi> whoſe Image Chriſt is, would be altogether idle. For turn your underſtanding which way you pleaſe, you ſhall find no other reaſon, why the Apoſtle did in that manner here deſcribe God, than to ſhew that it was therefore needful, that if we would know, and as it were view God, ſome Image of him, namely, Chriſt, ſhould be held forth unto us, and expoſed to the ſight of men, in as much as God is inviſible, and cannot be known by himſelf of any one of us, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in a full and perfect manner: which <hi>John</hi> alſo ſignifieth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time. The only begotten Son,</hi>

                           <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18.</note> 
                        <hi>who is in the boſome of the Father, he hath declared him.</hi> But if Chriſt, as he is the Image of God, were no leſs inviſible than God himſelf, we could no more know God by him, than God by himſelf; wherefore Chriſt could not be the Image of God. For it is apparent both from this deſcription of God, and alſo from that which is ſaid in the other place quoted by us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. that Chriſt was called the Image of God in reſpect of us; namely, becauſe he did repreſent in himſelf, and in a manner expoſe to our view the Will, Goodneſs, Power,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27. <hi>John</hi> 14 7, 9. and 18.19.</note> and Wiſdom of God. Whence Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>None knoweth the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him:</hi> and elſewhere, <hi>If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father alſo, and from henceforth ye know him:</hi> and a little after, <hi>He that ſeeth me, ſeeth the Father.</hi> But furthermore, although Chriſt was viſible according to the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet ought he not to be ſimply diſtinguiſhed from the inviſible God, and herein to be oppoſed to him, if he in the mean time were that moſt high and inviſible God. For if the name of <hi>God,</hi> namely, the moſt high God, may and ought to be abſolutely attributed unto Chriſt, as they hold; thoſe things alſo may and ought to be abſolutely attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to him; which are abſolutely ſpoken of God, and which agree to him in reſpect of his Eſſence. But if Chriſt may and ought for the divine Nature, to be abſolutely called inviſible, he ought not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to be diſtinguiſhed from the inviſible God.</p>
                     <p>Some other will perhaps ſay, that Chriſt is the Image of God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the humane Nature; which ſeemeth not diſagreeable to their Opinion, who together with us confeſs, that Chriſt is called the Image of God in reſpect of us, namely, becauſe he did in himſelf, as it were preſent to our view, the inviſible God. But in the firſt place, they are not conſtant enough to themſelves, whilſt they refer that which is the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64944:81"/> ſame with <hi>the Image of God,</hi> or at leaſt is of the ſame efficacy in our Argument, to the divine Nature; namely, that Chriſt is called <hi>the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Subſtance of God;</hi> for a Character hath not the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with the thing whoſe Character it is. Again, By this means Chriſt would have been the Image no leſs of his own divine Perſon or Nature, than of the Fathers; neither would there have been any cauſe why he ſhould be called the Image of another, rather than of himſelf. But we find not this, but that rather expreſſed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For when Chriſt is called the Image of God, all the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as far as I know, hold that the Father is underſtood; and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of that God from Chriſt, and finally, the collation of this kind of ſpeaking, with other-like ſayings of the Scripture, do ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſhew the ſame.</p>
                     <p>I omit that Chriſt did in himſelf, as it were preſent to our view, the inviſible God, in that he expreſſed his Will by Doctrine, his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by admirable Works, and clearly demonſtrated his Faith and Truth by both. But theſe things agree only to a Perſon, as ſuch, ſo that thoſe Adverſaries are forced to hold, either that his divine Perſon, as ſuch, is the Image of the Father, or that the humane Nature, if they will attribute this to it only, is a Perſon. The firſt of which, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth their Anſwer, the latter their Opinion. And let theſe things ſuffice to have been ſpoken concerning thoſe Arguments which ſo ſhew Chriſt not to be the moſt high God, as that withal they give a Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative to the Father above him.</p>

                  <p>VVE muſt now paſs to thoſe Arguments which abſolutely ſhew that Chriſt is not the moſt high God, without having any regard to this, that ſome Prerogative is withal given to the Father above him. Now though we might in this place alleage all the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of the Humanity of Jeſus Chriſt, as that he was conceived and born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that he did eat, drink, grow, that he was weary ſometimes, and did weep, and was diſturbed, and finally, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered moſt bitter torments, and dyed, and the like; yea, this very thing that he is and was a Man, in as much as none of thoſe things can be ſaid of the moſt high God, as they are, and that abſolutely of Chriſt, yet will we here only alleage thoſe things which contain ſome other Argument of our Opinion, beſides that which is common to all thoſe Attributes. Now the firſt ſhall be this, That if Jeſus were the moſt high God, he would no otherwiſe be ſo, then becauſe he is the Son of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64944:81"/> God. For neither can any greater thing be ſpoken of Jeſus Chriſt, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>31</label> 
                     <note place="margin">from The Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes why Chriſt is called the Son of God.</note> then that he is the Son of God: &amp; the Adverſaries themſelves hold, that he received the divine Eſſence by generation from the Father, which maketh him the Son of God. But from whence any one hath the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence, he hath alſo from thence, that he is God. But Jeſus is not therefore the moſt high God, becauſe he is the Son of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither is he ſimply the moſt high God.</p>
                  <p>Our Aſſumption ſhall not here be proved by this Reaſon, that Jeſus whilſt he is called the Son of God, is thereby diſtinguiſhed from God, namely, the ſupream and only God: Nor alſo that he is by this very name, made inferiour to the Father, as wholly depending from the Father, where as the Father dependeth from none other, for theſe reaſons we have before uſed. But we will prove the ſame by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Argument, and that a twofold one,<note place="margin">Chap. <hi>1, 2</hi> of this Section.</note> although other things alſo will be brought in by the by, whilſt we ſhall be imployed in proving the former; which things would alſo be fit to demonſtrate the very Queſtion, or principal Poſition it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is this, That whereas ſeveral cauſes are expreſſed in the holy Scriptures, for which Jeſus is the Son of God, yet none of them is ſuch, as conſtituteth him the moſt high God, in that they all agree to the Man Chriſt Jeſus, or (that we may ſpeak with the Adverſaries) agree to Chriſt, according to the humane Nature, and began at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time. Yea, they are ſo far from either conſtituting, or demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating Chriſt to be the moſt high God, as that they rather ſhew him not to be ſo; and conſequently each of them may juſtly be accounted as ſo many Arguments to aſſert our Opinion. But it is impoſſible, that if Jeſus be the Son of God in ſuch a manner as conſtituteth him the moſt high God, this thing ſhould be no where ſet down in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; partly becauſe we ſee other reaſons expreſt, which would be of far leſs moment than it; partly becauſe that Reaſon (as indeed the Adverſaries themſelves contend) would be altogether neceſſary to be known &amp; believed unto ſalvation, &amp; ſo much the more clearly to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by the ſacred Writers; and ſo much the more diligently &amp; fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be inculcated, by how much it was more removed from our ſences and capacity, and conſequently more difficult to be known and believed. For ſince the ſacred Scriptures<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>Now the thing that is ſignified by thoſe words, conſiſteth in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine reaſon, for which Jeſus is called the Son of God by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, which according to the opinion of the adverſarie, is becauſe he was from eternity begotten out of the Eſſence of the Father.

                        </gap>ter he writeth after this manner. <q>Though I for my part ſuppoſe that the words carry another ſenſe, and are not to be underſtood of Chriſt as God, nor as a man united to a divine perſon, but only of his conception and humane generation, as if the Angel ſhould ſay, He <hi>ſhall be called,</hi> that is <hi>be the Son of God,</hi> becauſe he ſhall be begotten not by a man but by God through the power of the holy Spirit. For neither did the Angel ſpeak concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of Chriſt, but of the manner of his generation. And the cauſe which he renders, why he ſhould be the Son of God, in that the holy Spirit ſhould come upon the Virgin, and the power of the moſt high overſhadow her, was not apt to prove that Chriſt ſhould be the Son of God, as he was God, or man aſſumed into the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with God; becauſe a meer man might be conceived by the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening of the holy Spirit, and overſhadowing power of the moſt high, who would be the Son of God neither of thoſe wayes; in as much as he was neither God, nor joyned to a divine Perſon. But to prove that what was to be born of the Virgin, ſhould be the Son of God in ſuch a ſence as I have declared, the reaſon of the Angel was very apt, in as much as the Child was to be conceived not of a man but of God alone. Wherefore, although Chriſt had not been God, yet being born in ſuch a manner as he was, he had deſervedly been called the Son of God, not only as other holy men, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>I ſaid ye are Gods,</hi> and <hi>ye are all Sons of the moſt high:</hi> but in a ſingular and proper manner, becauſe he had no other Father than God, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by no other than him.</q> What I pray you could be ſpoken more aptly and more ſuitably to the place? I was therefore willing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the whole matter in his words rather than in mine own, that it might with all appear by the teſtimony of a Papiſt, how evident this opinion is which we defend, concerning the reaſon expreſt in theſe words of the Angel, for which Jeſus is called the Son of God. For what elſe but the evidence of the thing it ſelf could move a Papiſt, eſpecially of that order to which he was adicted, that contrary to the conſent of all other Interpreters which he had ſeen, he ſhould follow the opinion which we hold? eſpecially ſince he knew that they whom he judged Hereticks, did urge this place for their opinion concerning Chriſt.

                     <p>The ſecond Cauſe therefore of this thing, is expreſt by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>John</hi> 10.34, 35, 36. For when the <hi>Jews</hi> had charged him with the crime of Blaſphemy, that being a Man, he made himſelf God, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe he had called God his Father, and ſaid that he was one with him, he giveth them this Anſwer, <hi>Is it not written in your Law, I ſaid ye are Gods? If he called them Gods to whom the Word of GOD came, and the Scripture cannot be broken: how ſay you of him whom the Father hath ſanctified, and ſent into the World: thou blaſphemeſt: becauſe I ſaid, I am the Son of God?</hi> Where it appeareth, that Chriſt bringeth this Reaſon, why he did with far greater Right call himſelf the Son of God, than thoſe Judges heretofore were called Gods, becauſe he was ſanctified of the Father, and ſent into the World. Now doth this Reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute Chriſt the moſt high God? For doth <hi>ſending,</hi> that I may ſpeak of this firſt, conſtitute the moſt high God? Hath it any conjunction with the Generation out of the Eſſence of the Frther? And is the Sanctification, that proceeded from the Father, incident to the divine Nature of Chriſt, and not rather to the humane? This certainly is both
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64944:83"/> confeſt by many of the Adverſaries, and averred by the thing it ſelf. For that which is ſanctified of God, acquireth fome ſanctity, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thing the ſame doth conſiſt. But this is not incident to the divine Nature exiſting from all Eternity, although it be to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane. For neither can any one ſay, that we alſo ſanctifie God and his Name, to whom notwithſtanding we procure no Sanctity. For as much as it is manifeſt, that God is ſanctified of us in a differnte man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then we are ſanctified of God. God is ſanctified of us, whilſt we acknowledge reverence, and proclaim his Sanctity and Majeſty; we of God, whilſt through his bounty we obtain ſome Sanctity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſhould otherwiſe be deſtitute. Now if the manner that God ſanctified Chriſt, were of the ſame kind with that wherein we ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God, and not rather with that wherein God ſanctifieth us, though different in kind and perfection, what would that Sanctification do to ſhew that Chriſt is by the greateſt right called the Son of God? For doth a Sanctification which proceedeth from us, conſtitute God to whom it tendeth, our ſon? and not rather that which proceedeth from God to us, conſtitute us his ſons; indeed in a more imperfect man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than Chriſt, becauſe our ſanctification is alſo more imperfect: but yet truly. Now what that Sanctification of Chriſt is, may eaſily be gathered from the <hi>ſending</hi> that is added thereunto. For that <hi>ſending</hi> herein conſiſteth, that the office of embaſſage unto men, is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God to Chriſt. But to ſanctifie, ſignifieth in the Scriptures, to ſegregate one from others, and chuſe him to a ſingular office, or, as it were, to prepare him for a more divine uſe. Wherefore it is either ſo taken in this plrce, as in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi>

                        </note> As learned men have noted both there, and in the quoted place of <hi>Jahn:</hi> for it is the ſame as to fill with the moſt ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Gifts, ſuch as is divine Power and Wiſdom, to diſcharge a moſt honourable Office on the Earth, and having by this means ſegregated one from other men, to prepare him in an eminent way to ſuch an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Wherefore the ſending into the world, containeth in it ſelf that very Office: but the Sanctification is a deſignation, or preparation thereunto. But of what moment are theſe things, to aſſert ſupream Divinity unto Chriſt, or to eſtabliſh the Generation of Chriſt out of the Eſſence of the Father from Eternity? Yea, they are ſo far from aſſerting ſupream Divinity unto Chriſt, that they rather demonſtrate that Chriſt is not the moſt high God. As concerning <hi>ſending,</hi> we have formerly † ſhewn it. The ſame is alſo to be held concerning Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which is a deſignation or preparation to that Office.<note place="margin">Chap. 15</note> For if the Office it ſelf be not incident to the moſt high God, neither can the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation or preparation to that Office be incident unto him, although the ſame may alſo be ſhewn from thoſe things which we have ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the places wherein it is affirmed, that ſomet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ing was given of God to Chriſt. For he that is ſanctified of God, hath thereby ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conferred upon him by God. But none conferreth any thing on
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64944:84"/> the moſt high God, who giveth all things to all. Beſides, if Chriſt had been the moſt high God, if he had been begotten out of the Eſſence of the Father from eternity, and for that cauſe the Son of God, how could it be he ſhould here conceale it. For if there were any place where this were to be expreſſed, certainly this were the place. Chriſt had affirmed, that he was one with the Father, which the Adverſaries will have to be ſpoken in reſpect of a divine Nature; for they ſay that it was therefore affirmed of him, that God was his Father, becauſe he was begotten out of his Eſſence; that he was therefore one with him, becauſe he had the ſame Eſſence in number with him. Moreover, the <hi>Jews</hi> did upon that account, charge him with Blaſphemy, becauſe that being a man, he made himſelf God. Where they take the name of <hi>God</hi> in ſuch a manner, as is not incident to a man: and our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries contend, that they mean it of the moſt high God; namely becauſe they obſerved that Chriſt did not obſcurely affirm himſelf, to be God in ſuch a manner. But if it be thus, it would have been altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary, that Chriſt ſhould bring ſuch a Reaſon, wherefore he is the Son of God, as might ſhew him to be begotten out of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Father, &amp; to have the ſame Eſſence with him, for otherwiſe how had he defended that ſaying of his, which the <hi>Jews</hi> charged with Blaſphemy? How had he ſhewn, that he of right called himſelf the Son of God in ſuch a manner as the Adverſaries would have it? The <hi>Jews,</hi> according to the Opinion of our Adverſaries, object to Chriſt; Thou art a Blaſphemer, becauſe thou affirmeſt thy ſelf to be the Son of God begotten out of his Eſſence, becauſe thou makeſt thy ſelf the moſt high God. Chriſt anſwereth, I rightly affirm this of my ſelf, nor am I therein a Blaſphemer, becauſe the Father hath ſanctified me, and ſent me into the world. What is this to a generation out of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God? What is this to the Supream and Independent God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, which Chriſt is believed to have challenged to himſelf? You will ſay, that Chriſt ſufficiently intimated, that he was begotten out of the Eſſence of the Father, and conſequently the moſt high God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaid that he was ſent of the Father into the world. For that this ſheweth, that he before he was born of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually with God in Heaven, and afterwards deſcended thence into the <hi>Virgins</hi> Womb, and became Man, which is incident to none but the moſt high God. But how frivolous theſe thing be, men would eaſily obſerve, if they would a little ſet aſide a predudicate Opinion. For, firſt, he might both be ſent, and come into the World, who never was in Heaven. The words of Chriſt himſelf concerning the Apoſtles, are in the ſame <hi>John</hi> very evident, where he alſo compareth them with himſelf in this behalf, chap. 17.18. <hi>As thou</hi> (Father) <hi>haſt ſent me into the world, have I alſo ſent them into the world.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> ſaith of falſe Prophets, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.1. that <hi>many falſe Prophets are gone out into the world.</hi> But neither had theſe nor thoſe been either in Heaven, or in any other place out of this World, whence they might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards enter into this World. But they were appointed the Embaſſadours of Chriſt unto men, and deſigned to preach the Goſpel
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64944:84"/> unto them: and theſe came of their own accord unto men, and as if they had been ſent of God unto them, preſuming to promulgate a new Doctrine amongſt them. Wherefore to be ſent into the World by God or Chriſt, is to be conſtituted his Embaſſadour unto men, but he may be the Embaſſadour of God unto men, who never was in Heaven. Again, though it were altogether neceſſary, that he whom God ſent into the world, ſhould firſt have been in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and have deſcended thence to the Earth, which thing we other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe willingly confeſs concerning Chriſt, yet what hinders that he, who is in his Nature nothing but a man, ſhould be aſſumed of God into Heaven, and being there furniſhed with inſtructions, be afterwards ſent down unto the Earth to men? and indeed it is altogether neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to hold it ſo, if you think that Chriſt could not be ſent into the World; or at leaſt was not otherwiſe ſent, then that he properly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from Heaven to the Earth. For it is ſufficiently apparent from our words, that this ſending did agree to Chriſt only according to the humane Nature, which certainly was not generated in Heaven, but on the Earth; and conſequently if it was in Heaven, as we alſo acknowledge, it muſt needs have aſcended thither. And indeed Chriſt himſelf doth intimate as much, whilſt he ſaith in this Writer, chap. 3.13. <hi>None hath aſcended into Heaven, but he that deſcended from Heaven, the Son of Man (which is</hi> or rather <hi>was in Heaven</hi>) Whence after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, chap. 6.63. he ſaith, <hi>If therefore ye ſhall ſee the Son of Man aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend where he was hefore.</hi> In both places he ſpaketh of the Son of Man, and here he doth not ſay, that he was at that very time in the Heaven, but had been formerly, and ſhould afterwards aſcend thither. From whence it manifeſtly appears, that he ſpeaks not of the divine Nature, which is neither the Son of Man, nor could ever leave Heaven, nor ever aſcend thither.</p>
                     <p>But furthermore, cannot an Angel whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64944:85"/> had <hi>raiſed up Jeſus.</hi> So that the Apoſtle doth not affirm, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Pſalm wherein it is ſpoken of Chriſts generation from God, was fulfilled in his very reſurrection, but after it, namely, when he was exalted, and made a King by God. But that anſwer which is alleaged concerning the declaration of this, namely, that Chriſt is the Son of God, is of no moment. For as to the firſt place, from whence a judgement may and ought to be made of the latter, the word <hi>begotten</hi> cannot be underſtood of the declaration of a generation out of the Eſſence of God already made from eternity. For to omit that by this meanes that nice obſervation falls to the ground, which very many of the adverſaries faſten upon thoſe word, <hi>to day,</hi> namely, that the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of God is thereby ſignified, wherein there is nothing paſt or future, but preſent only, in as much as it cannot be ſaid, that God did from all eternity declare, that Chriſt was begotten out of his Eſſencce; to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, I ſay, this nicety, there are other things which overthrow that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. For in the firſt place, what is this to the fulfilling of he Promiſe made to the Fathers, which God hath actually performed to their Children? They with whom we diſpute confeſs, and the thing it ſelf ſheweth, that the promiſe of giving the Meſſias is here underſtood. But how is it pertinent hereunto, that God hath declared that Chriſt is ſuch a Son, as was eternally begotten out of his Eſſence, for God could declare it many other wayes, were the thing otherwiſe true, than by giving or making of Jeſus a King, as they, with whom we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute affirm he hath declared, but by this way he could in no wiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the ſame, for that God hath made Jeſus King, is ſo far from ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing that he was eternally begotten out of the Eſſence of God, and conſequently the moſt high God, that the clean contrary is rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced from it, as we have before ſhewn, <hi>Chap</hi> 18. For if you ſay that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e made himſelf King, in the firſt place, <hi>Paul</hi> doth not here urge that, in as much as he manifeſtly attributeth not to Chriſt himſelf but to the Father, both his Reſurrection, and conſequently (as they will have it) the declaration of his generation out of the Eſſence of God. But the other, not this, ſhould have been urged by the Apoſtle, would he have intimated that Chriſt was declared to be the Son of God, begotten out of his Eſſence, by raiſing up himſelf from the dead. Again, although Chriſt had raiſed up himſelf, yet from the raiſing it ſelf, whether you underſtand it of Chriſts nativity, or of his reſurrection from the dead, it would not have appeared, whereas it ought to have appeared, if the raiſing of Chriſt ought to declare that Jeſus was begotten out of the Eſſence of God, becauſe he raiſed himſelf. Now that it did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear is evident enough, for into whoſe mind would it come, either that he who is born is the author of his own nativity, or that he who riſeth from the dead is the author of his own reſurrection? inaſmuch as he who is born had no being befo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e, and he that riſeth had by death loſt his being, and is, as to the ſtrength whereby he might riſe, like unto him who is to be born.</p>
                     <p>It would be therefore neceſſary, that it ſhould ſome otherway have been evident, that there was another Nature in him, which did both
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64944:86"/> really exiſt before his Nativity, and alſo actually lived during his death, and conſequently was the true cauſe either of his Nativity, or of his Reſurrection: but this was the very thing which the Adverſaries hold to have been declared by the raiſing him up, and to have been appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from it. Finally, although it had been apparent, that Chriſt had raiſed up himſelf, yet how had it thence appeared, that he was the natural Son of God, eternally begotten out of his Eſſence? For not to repeat that which we formerly ſhewd, namely, that from the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Adverſaries, it followeth, that the Soul of Chriſt could by divine Power raiſe its own Body; to omit likewiſe, that ſome other Spirit, which had before been united to his Body, might by divine Power have performed this: if the moſt high God can raiſe up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, what hinders but that it was either the Father himſelf or the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, whom they make the third Perſon of the <hi>Deity.</hi> Be it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it appeared from the raiſing of Chriſt, that he himſelf was the Author thereof; be it that it appeared that he was the moſt high God, what argueth that he was eternally begotten out of the Eſſence of God? what connexion is there of the one with the other?</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, what man is there, who haveing looked into the words of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> doth not obſerve that this is the meaning of them, <hi>Thou art my Son, becauſe I have this day begotten thee?</hi> What man alſo is there who doth not withal obſerve, that it is far more ſuitable to this ſence, that the word <hi>begotten,</hi> ſhould rather be taken to denote, the act of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating, than the declaration of a generation? What man is there, who, if he here ſuch words as theſe, would underſtand them thus, <hi>Thou art my Son, becauſe I have this day declared that I have begotten thee;</hi> and not rather thus, <hi>Thou art my Son, becauſe I have this day really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goten thee?</hi> But what need many words? for if the reſurrection of Chriſt, and the conſequent exaltation or advancement to a Kingdom, eſpecially a Prieſtly one, is a certain generation from God, and one may therefore be juſtly called the Son of God, although no other more ſublime generation did precede, why ſhould any one underſtand that generation, whereof mention is made in the words of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the declaration of an antecedent generation, than of the very act of generating? Since that which is expreſſed by the word begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, was accompliſhed by the reſurrection and exaltation of Chriſt. But we have already ſhewn, that the Reſurrection of Chriſt, was a certain Generation from God; and we will a little after more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the advancement to a Kingdom, none can make a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who conſiders that Kings, Princes and Judges, are by God himſelf called both <hi>gods,</hi> and alſo the <hi>ſons of God,</hi> or of the <hi>Moſt High, Pſal.</hi> 82.6. which place Chriſt citeth, <hi>John</hi> 10.34. to ſhew that he did not blaſpheme in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aying, that he was the Son of God. But in that place, regard is had to nothing but the authority and dominion, to which they were advanced by God. For to all them in general, the name of gods, and ſons of God is attributed as they are diſtinguſhed from men of an inferiour rank. And ſee, I pray you, how excellently theſe
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64944:86"/> things agree both to the other words of the ſecond <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and alſo to the ſcope of the Apoſtle, fetching a Teſtimony from thence. For it is apparent from both, that in theſe words, <hi>Thou art my Son, I have this day begotten thee,</hi> it is ſpoken of making Chriſt a King. For after God had ſaid, <hi>I have ſet my King on Zion, my holy Mount, David</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth, <hi>I will declare the Decree;</hi> what <hi>Decree,</hi> but ſuch a one as was made concerning that thing, whereof he had begun to ſpeak; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God had ſet him King on <hi>Zion, his holy Mountain?</hi> But what are the words of the <hi>Decree? The Lord ſaith he ſaid unto me, Thou art my Son, I this day begat thee.</hi> Why then do we ſeek ſtarting holes? why go we about the buſh? why do not we directly and ſimply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand theſe things concerning the Generation of Chriſt, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in advancing him to a Kingdom by that Reſurrection, rather then concerning the declaration of a Generation out of the Eſſence of God from al eternity, whereof there is here neither hint, nor footſtep? By this means we may elegantly apply theſe words likewiſe to <hi>David,</hi> a Type of Chriſt, although in a far lower ſence; to whom, that they are to be applyed, both the very words of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> make a ſhew, and others alſo before us have obſerved. For when God had ſometimes reſcued <hi>David</hi> out of ſundry calamities, and alſo out of the very jaws of death, and made him Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> over his People, he did in a manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get him, and make him his Son, and that ſuch a Son, as would in re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpect of other earthly Kings, become the firſt-born in power and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Whence God ſpeaketh thus of him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.28. <hi>I will make him, my Firſt-born, higher than the Kings of the Earth.</hi> But what agreed to <hi>David</hi> in that ſence, doth in a far nobler way agree to Chriſt, <hi>who being raiſed from the dead, was ſet at the right hand of God in heavenly places, far above all Principallities, and Powers, and Force, and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but alſo in the world to come; and all things were put in ſubjection under his feet, and he was made Head over all things to the Church, which is his Body, the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all.</hi> May he not juſtly be ſaid to have been begotten by God, to have become his Son? for he was not only begotten anew to an immortal life by the reſurrection, but alſo did by the bounty of God, become very like to him in Power and Empire, for which God himſelf is called God. But by reaſon of ſimilitude with God, both Angels and Men are called Sons of God; which the greater it is, the more juſtly doth this name agree unto them: but no compleater ſimilitude can be imagined than that which we even now ſhewed to agree to Chriſt, whereby he doth ſo far ſurpaſs both all Angels and Men, that they in reſpect of Chriſt, are rather to be called Servants than Sons.</p>
                     <p>From hence it is already apparent, what is alſo to be thought of that other place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. Although the place doth ſufficiently guard it ſelf without forreign help againſt the vulgar interpretation. For nei-doth the ſcope of the Apoſtle, nor the words, nor the thing it ſelf, ſuffer us to underſtand, that Chriſt by the reſurrection from the dead, was declared the Son of God begotten out of his Eſſence. For the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64944:87"/> ſcope of the Apoſtle is to explain not how Jeſus Chriſt was declared the Son of God, but how he is the Son of God; for having deſcribed Chriſt by the name of the Son of God, he accordingly declareth how this is to be underſtood. And leſt any one ſhould perhaps think, that it will thence follow, that he is not the Son of <hi>David,</hi> which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Scripture averreth, he ſheweth how hoth may ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Firſt, he teacheth how he is the Son of <hi>David,</hi> then how he is the Son of God; wherefore he ſaith, <hi>Who was made of the Seed of David according to the fleſh, who was determined or conſtituted the Son of God in Power according to the Spirit of Sanctification, by the Reſurrection from the dead.</hi> Doth not the very oppoſition ſhew, that, as it is there taught how Chriſt is indeed the Son of <hi>David,</hi> ſo it is here ſignified how he is indeed the Son of God? for neither would a declaration be rightly oppoſed to the word <hi>made,</hi> nor thoſe diverſe reſpects be one oppoſed to the other, namely, <hi>according to the fleſh, and according to the Spirit of Holineſs;</hi> that is, according to the Spirit wherewith Chriſt was ſanctified. For that expreſſion <hi>according to the fleſh,</hi> would ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the reaſon of the ſubject; whereas the other, <hi>according to the Spirit of Holineſs,</hi> would denote only the middle efficient Cauſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the word here rendered <hi>determined,</hi> doth no where in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yea, no where at all, ſignifie to be declared, unleſs you take the word <hi>declared,</hi> as it is then taken when one is ſaid to be declared King or Conſul, whilſt he is conſtituted, and this Office is appointed to him. For the Greek word properly ſignifies to <hi>define,</hi> to determine, but in the Scripture it ſignifies nothing but to conſtitute, <hi>to decree or deſign,</hi> which thing doth excellently agree to Chriſt, in that he was made King by the intervening of the reſurrection.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luke</hi> 22.22. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.42 &amp; 11.29. &amp; 17.31.</note> But if you will with the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent interpreter, render it to <hi>predeſtinate,</hi> although neither the ſimple word it ſelf requireth that verſion, nor the thing ſuffer it; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, it will be ſufficiently evident, that Chriſt was not really the Son of God from eternity. For neither is that predeſtinated which is in being, but which is not yet in being, and here it is ſpoken of no other thing, than of the Sonſhip of Chriſt in relation to God. Yea, it will follow, that he at length in the reſurrection, was fully ordained to be the Son of God. Finally, in the former place, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. we have ſhewn that the reſurrection of Chriſt, had in no wiſe declared, that Chriſt was begotten of the Eſſence of God, and ſo was the Son of God, but rather the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Now that which concerns their Opinion, who contend that the Greek word in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. is not to be referred unto the reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead: but unto his birth and firſt exhibition, which although we can both grant and urge without prejudice to our principal Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet we will ſhew that this interpretation cannot ſubſiſt. Firſt, becauſe in that place, as we have already obſerved, ſuch an act of God is ſpoken of, as whereby he fulfilled his promiſe of ſetting up a King over the <hi>Jews;</hi> which we have alſo ſhewn out of the words of the ſecond <hi>Pſalm.</hi> But Chriſt was not then made Lord and Chriſt, or the heavenly King of Gods People when he was born: but when he was
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64944:87"/> raiſed and ſet at the right hand of God. Furthermore, both the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding and following words of the Apoſtle, which they urge againſt us, ſhew that it is ſpoken of the reſurrection from the dead. For when he had ſaid, that <hi>God had raiſed him</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>on the third day,</hi> he adds, <hi>being ſeen many dayes of thoſe that accompanyed him from</hi> Galilee <hi>to</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>who are his witneſſes unto the people until now.</hi> But whereof were they witneſſes, if not of that which he had juſt now mentioned, and told them had been in ſome meaſure preſented to their view, namely, the reſurrection of Chriſt, and his exaltation, which followed thereupon? for of this thing they were properly witneſſes. See above, chap. 1.22. &amp; 2.32. &amp; 3.15. &amp; 4.33. &amp; 5.32. compared with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, and chap. 10.40, 41, 42. Therefore ſeeing the Apoſtle ſubjoyns, <hi>And we declare this unto you which was promiſed to our Fathers, becauſe</hi> (or that) <hi>God hath fulfilled the ſame unto us their Children, having raiſed up Jeſus;</hi> and it is neceſſary that he himſelf ſhould ſpeak of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt from the dead. For he affirms that he had now declared the ſame thing to the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> that the other Apoſtles had teſtified to the People of <hi>Judea.</hi> If he then told them that he was a witneſs to the people of the reſurrection, and following exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he intimates that he now alſo ſpeaketh of the ſame thing. But that which belongs to the following words by them urged againſt us, is not at length proved in that place, that Chriſt was raiſed from the dead: but that being ſuppoſed as already ſufficiently proved, it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhews, that Chriſt was ſo raiſed from the dead, as no more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to corruption. For ſome one might have ſcrupled, that though Chriſt were indeed raiſed from the dead, yet the promiſe made unto the Fathers be unperformed, ſeeing Chriſt might have been ſo raiſed, as afterwards to have returned unto corruption; whereas the Meſſiah promiſed of old unto the Fathers, and his Government, ought to endure unto the end of the world; as the Writings of the Prophets teach; See 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.13, 14. and compare it with <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7. (compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.8.) and 110.1, 4. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.14. as alſo <hi>John</hi> 12.34. The Apoſtle therefore removes this doubt from his hearers, whilſt he adds, <hi>But that he hath raiſed him from the dead, no more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto corruption,</hi> thus he ſaid, <hi>I will give unto you the ſure Mercies of David; namely, the Promiſe that proceeded from Grace and Mercy,</hi> and ſo onward. Whereby we underſtand that he had ſpoken of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection in the words immediately preceding, and ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſame; now to remove all manner of doubt, he is willing to ſpeak of the ſame matter ſomewhat larger, although that be alſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, that <hi>Paul,</hi> having but newly ſaid that Chriſt was at firſt exhibited, and either born or ſent into the world, ſhould preſently add, that God had ſo raiſed him from the dead, as no more to return to corruption. For what connexion is there? Is it not evident, that thoſe latter words require that the Apoſtle ſhould ſpeak next of his Reſurrection?</p>
                     <p>But that which concerns thoſe, who ſay that the promiſe of Chriſt, and that expreſſion in the ſecond <hi>Pſalm,</hi> God had not fulfilled in raiſing of Chriſt, but when he was riſen; we will not much contend with them
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64944:88"/> for we our ſelves freely confeſs, if the raiſing of Chriſt be taken in a ſtrict ſence, barely for his returning to life, without reſpect to his exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion afterwards, that divine promiſe and expreſſion of the Pſalm, had not as yet been really performed. But yet notwithſtanding it is to be noted firſt, that the expreſſion of raiſing, or reſurrection of Chriſt, doth ſometimes by a kind of Synecdoche joyned with a Metonymie, comprehend the whole Glory of Chriſt, to wit, Immortality and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Power that he obtained by the Reſurrection. And in this ſence only this word ſeems to be taken, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.32, 33. <hi>and</hi> 4.33. (compared with 5.32. &amp; 10 40, &amp;c.) <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. &amp; 10.9. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. and 3.21. Furthermore, it is alſo to be obſerved, that the Participle Ao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts, being joyned to Verbs of the Pretertenſe, have oftentimes the ſame force as Participles of the Preſentenſe when they are joyned to the ſame Verbs. Whereof you have examples amongſt others in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.4. &amp; 7.21. &amp; 11.9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6, 15. beſides that which is every where found in the Evangeliſts, <hi>he anſwering, ſaid.</hi> Wherefore it may be rightly concluded, that the Apoſtles words are to be underſtood, as if he had ſaid, God hath fulfilled the Promiſe made unto the Fathers, <hi>having raiſed</hi> (as an antient Interpreter hath it) <hi>or in raiſing Jeſus;</hi> chiefly becauſe unto Chriſts generation of God, the very reſtoring of him to life, did alſo conduce, ſeeing that thereby he was as it were begotten again: but the Immortality which Chriſt obtained by the intervening of the Reſurrection, was far more available. After this manner indeed he became like unto God in his Nature; whereupon our Reſurrection alſo is called Regeneration: and Chriſt affirmeth, that they who ſhall be counted worthy of that Age, and the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the dead, <hi>are the Sons of God, ſeeing they are the Children of the Reſurrection,</hi> Luke 20.36 And <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, <hi>That we look for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption of the Sons of God, even the redemption of our bodies,</hi> Rom. 8.23. <hi>For the fellowſhip or participation of the divine Nature,</hi> which <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of 2 Pet. 1, 4. doth principally conſiſt in Immortality. But hither tends moſt of all the divine Empire and Power of Chriſt, for which he is the Son of God in the perfecteſt manner. If therefore you will only interpret the Greek Particle, <hi>Jeſus being riſen,</hi> or <hi>after that he had raiſed Jeſus,</hi> we ſhould underſtand, that the Promiſe made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fathers, was then really and perfectly fulfilled touching the Meſſiah, or an extraordinary King that was to be given to the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, and moreover alſo, that expreſſion of the Pſalm, <hi>Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee,</hi> when Jeſus was raiſed from the dead by God, and ſet at his right hand in the heavenly places, and ſo made Chriſt, or a King, and Lord, by the Power and Grace of God. For hence, as we have already<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. <hi>28.</hi> of this Sect.</note> ſeen, doth the Divine Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> chap. 5.5. take thoſe words of the Pſalm, touching the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Chriſt, on the Prieſtly honour that was conferred upon him, which doth indeed contain his Royal Power, ſeeing that his Kingdom is Prieſtly, and his Prieſthood Royal. And hereupon they are elſewhere alſo in holy Scripture, taken for the ſame thing, that Jeſus is the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and that Jeſus is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is, a King anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64944:88"/> by God over his people, or a <hi>Lord,</hi> even him by whom alone God would adminiſter and govern his Church, with all things belonging to her. For upon this account the principal doctrine of the ſupream dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt, and our faith and confeſſion of him are promiſcuouſly<note n="†" place="margin">

See <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.16.26.63. <hi>John</hi> 6.69.11.27.20.31. And it is firſt of all to be noted, that that famous Confeſſion of <hi>Peter,</hi> touching Chriſt and his ſupream dignity, being likewiſe declared in the name of the other diſciples, is deſcribed by <hi>Matthew, Chap.</hi> 16.16. in theſe words, <hi>Thou art Chriſt, the Son of the living God.</hi> But by <hi>Mark Chap.</hi> 8.29. only in theſe words, <hi>Thou art Chriſt:</hi> By <hi>Luke, Chap.</hi> 9 20. <hi>The Chriſt of God:</hi> Which two latter Evangeliſts would have left out one, and a principal part indeed of that confeſſion, if it had been one thing <hi>to be the Son of the living God,</hi> and another thing <hi>to be Chriſt.</hi> But if both be indeed the ſame thing, they have in effect omitted nothing, but only expreſſed the ſame thing more briefly. But now to be Chriſt, or to be anointed of God, doth in no wiſe conſtitue the moſt high God, nor argue him to be ſo, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſeeing that the moſt high God can be anointed by none, nor be made a King by any one.</p>
                     <p>And leaſt haply any ſhould ſay that there ſtill remaines another, and that a more ſublime cauſe, for which Jeſus may be called the Son of God; that is refuted partly by the Scriptures ſilence thereof, which could not have omitted ſo great a matter, and partly from thoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Scripture we have hitherto alleaged. For not here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat other things, if there had been any other weightier cauſe for for which Jeſus might be called the Son of God, it could in no wiſe have been omitted in the place before examined by us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. For there, as we have ſeen, the Apoſtle intended to ſhew by what reaſon Chriſt may be called the Son of God; but he doth not in that place take the name <hi>of the Son of God</hi> in any other ſignification than that which is moſt excellent, whilſt he deſcribeth him by the appellation <hi>of the Son of God,</hi> the proper name of Jeſus Chriſt ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ing not as yet been expreſſed. Wherefore we ought to think that he hath expreſſed the moſt excellent, or if you will rather, the true and genuine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that appellation. But doth he expreſs that to be the cauſe of that thing, that Chriſt was begotten out of the Eſſence of God from eternity, and ſo was the moſt high God? by no means: but this rather, which contradicts that and ſuffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s not that Chriſt ſhould be the moſt high God, when he ſaith, that he was <hi>made the Son of God,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>according to the Spirit of holineſs,</hi> that is according to the Spirit wherewith he was ſanctified, and that by <hi>the reſurrection from the dead.</hi>
                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:64944:89"/> for that ſome underſtand, <hi>by the Spirit of holineſs,</hi> the divine Eſſence, it is done both without an example and without reaſon, yea contrary to the word <hi>ordained</hi> or <hi>appointed,</hi> and finally to the reſurrection from the dead, from which, or by which that might have come to paſs. It is manifeſt therefore that there is no other more ſublime cauſe for which Jeſus may be called the Son of God but this, that being raiſed from the dead, he was made by God both Lord and Chriſt, or the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and eternal King of his people. Moreover the ſame thing is plainly ſeen from the ſecond Pſalm, a place that we have explained al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. For all, as I know, confeſs, that when God ſpeaketh thus unto Chriſt, <hi>thou art my Son,</hi> the name of the Son of God is taken in the moſt excellent manner. But we have ſeen that this is the cauſe why he is in that place called the Son of God, becauſe he, being raiſed from the dead, was not only made immortal, but alſo the King of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and beſides, the Prieſt and Prince of our Salvation, as we have ſhewn partly from the very Pſalm, and partly from <hi>Acts</hi> 13. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. Whereto may be added <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.4, 5. For, when the divine Author had there ſaid, that Chriſt having purged away our ſins by himſelf, was ſet at the right hand of God on high, he adds: <hi>Being made ſo much better,</hi> or rather <hi>more honourable than the Angels, as he had inherited a more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> (that is) <hi>a better and more excellent name than they. For to which of the Angels ſaid he at any time: thou art my Son, this day have I begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he ſhall be to me a Son.</hi> From which place it is underſtood, that the name of the Son of God is not Eſſential unto Chriſt, whilſt he is ſaid to have inherited it, nor that it is the name of the moſt high God, for as much as by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation he obtained a dignity and excellency, equal to that name and title, which doth not happen to the moſt high God. Beſides the thing it ſelf ſhews that Chriſt is here ſpoken of according to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, as they ſay, and alſo that this is ſuch a name as agrees to Chriſt according to that nature. Unto which alſo the following paſſage accords, <hi>I will be unto him a Father, and he ſhall be to me a Son,</hi> wherein the ſame ſence is expreſſed. For theſe words do in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner argue that it is not ſpoken of ſuch a thing, as is proper to the moſt high God, and was in being from all eternity. For both the words do openly reſpect ſomething future, and in the firſt and literal ſenſe, as they ſay, were ſpoken moſt clearly of <hi>Solomon</hi> the type of Chriſt in that reſpect, as others alſo confeſs. Compare 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.14. with the words both foregoing and following, and 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.10. and 26.6. compare alſo 1 <hi>King</hi> 5.5.8.19. It is therefore neceſſary, that there ſhould be ſuch a ſimilitude and analogie between the reaſon whereby Chriſt is the Son of God, &amp; that whereby <hi>Solomon</hi> was the Son of God, inaſmuch as this is a certain repreſentation of that; but how was that, whereby <hi>Solomon</hi> was the Son of God, a certain repreſentation of this whereby Chriſt is the Son of God, if Jeſus be therefore the Son of God, becauſe he was begotten of the Fathers Eſſence from eternity, and ſo the ſame God with the Father? But if Jeſus be the Son of God, by reaſon of moſt high love, and the benefits flowing from the ſame, which God
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64944:89"/> beſtowed upon him, amongſt which the heavenly Kingdom and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that was granted unto him, holdeth the principal place. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> is rightly conſtituted the type of Chriſt, and the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ds, uttered of him in the litteral ſenſe, are rightly and elegantly referred unto him, in a myſtical and far ſtricter ſenſe. It is evident therefore, that neither in the words of the ſecond Pſalm, there cited, is any thing contained of the eternal generation of Chriſt out of the Fathers Eſſence. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who doubteth, when <hi>Peter</hi> had confeſſed that Jeſus was the Son of God, or when we are commanded to believe and confeſs the ſame thing of him, if we would be accounted Chriſtians, and be ſaved, that the name of the Son of God, is taken in the moſt perfect ſignification, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it agrees unto Chriſt? But we ſaw then that it doth in very deed ſignify no otherwiſe, than that Jeſus is Chriſt, or a King appointed of God, and ſet over his people, to defend and preſerve them for ever. wherefore it is to be concluded that this is the principal reaſon, for which he is called the Son of God, neither can any better be found. But ſince that doth not conſtitute Chriſt the moſt high God, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhews that he is not the moſt high God; it follows, that there is no other cauſe of his Son-ſhip, as they ſay, which can make Chriſt the moſt high God.</p>
                     <p>We have ſpoken ſomewhat largly of the firſt reaſon, which ſhews, that Chriſt is not the moſt high God, therefore becauſe he is the Son of God; partly becauſe, if we rightly obſerve, there are more arguments of our opinion contained in it; and partly becauſe this, that Chriſt is the Son of God, is commonly believed to contain the ſtrongeſt argument of the contrary opinion. Wherefore it is to be ſhewn in a few wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ds, how exceedingly men commonly err, and the true opinion be proved from the reaſon whereby Chriſt is the Son of God.</p>
                     <p>There follows now another proof of the principal Arguments Aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, which we will diſpatch very briefly, namely,<note place="margin">

                        </gap>ure, that Chriſt died for us, according to that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, according to which he was the Son of God, and indeed only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and proper. But if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e were in that manner the Son of God as he was begotten of the Eſſence of God, and ſo was the moſt high God, he could not have died according to that nature, according to which he is the Son of God. For the moſt high God, as ſuch, cannot die, yea, cannot in any reſpect whatſoever. But that which we have already ſpoken of Chriſt, is from thence manifeſt, that the greateſt love of God towards us, is in the holy Scriptures ſhewn from this, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered <hi>his only begotten,</hi> or, <hi>his own Son unto death for us.</hi> See <hi>John</hi> 3.16. compared with <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. and <hi>Rom,</hi> 8.32. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10. compared with <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. aforegoing: add alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. compared with <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. But if Chriſt died not according to that nature, according to which he was the Son of God; but according to another nature, which was added to the perſon of the only begotten Son of God, it can neither be truly ſaid of the proper and only begotten Son of God, that he died, or was given for us; neither can the greateſt love of God towards us be from thence collected. For what ſo great wonder is it, for ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64944:90"/> of the only begotten Son of God, or ſome nature, that was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto him, to have been beſtowed on us, if in the mean while the only begotten Son of God, who was from eternity, had apparently remained ſafe and enti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e, nor had he felt any the leaſt pain thereby? Wherefore then is this ſo vehemently urged, that God delive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed up his Son for us, even his proper and only begotten Son, or that he ſhould dy for us, that from thence the greatneſs of the divine love might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>VVE are able to frame a ſecond Argument, that if Chriſt were the moſt high God, who, as that opinion requires, came down from heaven into the womb of a Virgin, and was there incarnated, it were altogether neceſſary, that this incarnation ought to have been moſt plainly expreſſed, not in one, but many places by the Writers of the Goſpel and other divine men and the Apoſtles.

Again, How often do the Apoſtles commend the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great love and bounty of God exhibited in Chriſt Jeſus to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? But what more illuſtrious argument could there have been of this love, then that the moſt high God ſhould willingly be made man for mans ſake? Wherefore then is there ſo great ſilence in thoſe places concerning this thing? Namely, becauſe it never was, neither was there any (that we may briefly add this thing alſo) cauſe which did require that the moſt high God, the creator of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth ſhould aſſume fleſh. For as much as the man Chriſt Jeſus being aſiſted by divine power, was able to performe; and did really performe when he was upon earth all things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed unto our ſalvation both in teaching, and alſo in working miracles, and finally, in obeying his Father in all things, and was able alſo to performe, and did ſo indeed performe by the ſame divine power whatſoever things are required to the perfecting of our Salvation. But who dares to ſay, that God would admit a thing ſo contrary to his Majeſty, without the greateſt cauſe, or rather neceſſity, although at length it were poſſible for his nature?

And <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.2. That Chriſt in the ſame day wherein he was taken up, <hi>gave commandment to the Apoſtles by the holy Spirit,</hi> that is by the motion of the holy Spirit. For neither did he make uſe of the miniſtry of the holy Spirit, by whoſe intervening help he gave commandments to his diſciples; although o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by tranſpoſition connect the words <hi>by the holy Spirit,</hi> with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>whom he had choſen,</hi> whereof it is not neceſſary to diſpute in this place. For as to our purpoſe the force of the words will be the ſame, to wit, that Chriſt by the motion of the holy Spirit choſe the Apoſtles. Neither is it a wonder, ſeeing that he was <hi>the Spirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and underſtanding, the Spirit of counſel, the Spirit of knowledge,</hi> that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64944:92"/> is, who produced Wiſdom, Underſtanding, Counſel, Knowledge, and beſtowed it on Chriſt, as appears from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. a place cited by us.</p>
                  <p>But that we may from hence demonſtrate, that Chriſt is not the moſt high God, we will not now uſe that reaſon, that by this means ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was given unto him by God the Father: which Argument we have<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. <hi>18.</hi> of this Sect.</note> elſewhere explained: but this, that he would not truly have ſtood in need of the holy Spirit, if he were the moſt high God, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if that Opinion of the Adverſaries be laid down, that the holy Spirit is a Perſon diſtinct from the Father and the Son. For what help, I pray you, can the holy Spirit yield unto the moſt high God? What is there that the moſt high God cannot perform of himſelf? For it is not what they ſay, that Chriſt's humane Nature needed the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the holy Spirit. For that I may not urge that now, that thoſe things are ſpoken ſimply of Chriſt, that are not to be ſpoken if he were the moſt high God, as of whom they are ſimply to be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: What need was there of the help of the holy Spirit, the third Perſon of the Deity, as they will have it, unto the humane Nature, if the very ſame was perſonally joyned to the ſecond Perſon of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; if the whole fulneſs of the divine Eſſence (as they interpret that place <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9.) did dwell therein bodily; if, as the ſame perſons judge, that divine Nature did beſtow all the ſupernatural Gifts upon the humane, that hapned unto it; if that did either communicate unto it all its Properties, or at leaſt the full knowledge of all things, as the major part of the Adverſaries judge? Whether or no the holy Spirit could add any thing to this ſtore? Wherefore, I pray, is Chriſt deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered rather by the holy Spirit, than by his own Nature, either to have caſt out Devils, or to have commanded any thing, or to have been endued with Wiſdom, Underſtanding, Counſel, Might, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the Fear of the Lord?</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>The Defence of the Argument.</head>
                     <p>SOme one will perhaps ſay, that therefore thoſe things are rather attributed to the holy Spirit, than to the divine Nature or Perſon of Chriſt, becauſe they belong unto Chriſts Sanctification, and that Sanctification, although common to the whole Trinity, is properly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the holy Spirit. But they ſpeak thus not only without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but even contrary to reaſon. We will not now rehearſe that, that Chriſt's Sanctification cannot be rather attributed to the holy Spirit, than to the Father, to whom the ſame is ſo aſcribed,<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>John</hi> 10.36.</note> that it is urged as a cauſe why Chriſt is his Son: For hence it would follow, if the the ſame agree rather to the holy Spirit, than to the Father, that the holy Spirit would be rather the Father of Chriſt, than God himſelf, who both is the Father of Chriſt, and is every where in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament ſo called. That we will ſay here, which is proper to this place, if any reaſon can be imagined, why that, which is common to all the Perſons, ſhould notwithſtanding be aſcribed rather to one, than
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64944:92"/> to another; that here would be great cauſe, why this action is rather to be aſcribed to the Son, than to any other Perſon, and indeed a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cauſe. The one is that moſt ſtrict conjunction which agreeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Son according to his humane Nature; as the Adverſaries Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion urges. The other is, that the ſame Adverſaries will have the Son to be the natural Wiſdom and Power of God, by which he makes all things; and hither they bring thoſe words which in <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. are ſpoken abſtractively, and in general touching Wiſdom; and alſo thoſe which we read of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. But unto which divine Perſon would it rather agree to beſtow on the humane Nature of Chriſt Wiſdom, Underſtanding, Counſel, Knowledge, than to that, which was neareſt unto that Nature, and is the natural Wiſdom of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? To what would it better agree, than to the natural Vertue and Power of God, to do all thoſe ſtupendious works by the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? All thoſe things therefore are rather to be attributed to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature of Chriſt, than to the holy Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, we demand of them that make uſe of this kind of excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether or no they determine, that the holy Spirit contributed more to the beſtowing of thoſe Gifts upon the humane Nature, than the divine Perſon of Chriſt himſelf, or as much the one as the other Perſon? If that, they overthrow their own Opinion; if this, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For if they admit that, either there was not ſo much power in the divine Perſon of Chriſt to perform the ſame, as was in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, or not ſo great a will. Neither can be ſpoken of it, if Chriſt were the moſt high God, and indeed of the ſame Eſſence with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit. But if they admit this, there will be no evident cauſe, why it ſhould be expreſly attributed to the holy Spirit, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed thoſe Gifts on the man Chriſt, and no where to the divine Perſon or Nature of Chriſt himſelf. Wherefore this exception hath there no place, and conſequently neither the diſtinction of a humane and divine Nature in Chriſt. For this very thing we demand, why was the holy Spirit given to the humane Nature, if that were perſonally united to the divine Nature.</p>

                  <p>THe fourth Argument of this kind, is this, that Chriſt, as the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Goſpel declareth, was tempted of the<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </note> Devil, and ſollicited to worſhip him, and that he was to this very end, namely, that he might be tempted of the Devil, led by the holy Spirit into the wilderneſs. For this would by no means have hapned, if Chriſt had been the moſt high God. For firſt, what is more unworthy of God, than to expoſe himſelf to this impious and wicked Enemy, whom for the contempt of his Majeſty, moſt clearly heretofore ſeen, he had thruſt out of Heaven, to be tempted and ſollicited to the adoration of him, and ſo to offer himſelf of his own accord to be mocked of the Devil? Again, to what purpoſe ſhould Chriſt do this? was it that it might appear, that the moſt high God was able to endure and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the temptations of the Devil? was there any one who could make any doubt thereof, ſo that there ſhould need any tryal thereof? Furthermore, how durſt the Devil attempt ſo great a matter? I will not now mention, that the Devils tremble at the ſight of the divine Majeſty,<note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19.</note> inaſmuch as they are afraid at the memory of him, in that they were by him caſt out of Heaven, and thruſt down to Hell. For feign you now in the wicked ſpirit, who is very conſcious both of the Wrath and invincible Power of God, and of the bonds wherein he is held by him, as much boldneſs and impudency as you pleaſe, yet muſt you withal confeſs, that he is exceeding cunning; and I would this were not to be confeſt! But how can it be, that a moſt cunning ſpirit ſhould tempt the moſt high God, and endeavour to ſeduce him, and conceive in his mind ſuch a project, as that he ſhould ſollicite him to a thing moſt unworthy and deteſtable, namely, the adoration of the Devil? For can it be, either that he ſhould attempt a thing which he well knoweth to be impoſſible, or ſhould not clearly perceive that this thing is altogether impoſſible? Neither of theſe things are incident to him, that hath ſo much as a grain of wit, much leſs could it happen to a moſt ſubtil and cunning ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, when he ſaith, <hi>If thou art the Son of God, command that theſe ſtones become loaves;</hi> And again, <hi>If thou art the Son of God, caſt thy ſelf down:</hi> He ſufficiently ſheweth, that his intention is to make Chriſt by ſome means, to begin to doubt, whether he be indeed the Son of God, whom he had a little before<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64944:93"/> For do we think, that an enemy moſt practiſed in this kind of fighting, who is commonly called the Author of a thouſand cunning tricks, did here uſe ſuch a kind of tempting, as was the unfitteſt of all to deceive, and ſo made uſe of arms ſo vain and ridiculous, to aſſail a moſt valiant and wiſe Captain? What would Satan get, if by any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he ſhould endeavour to perſwade even a common man (who is well in his wits) to doubt of himſelf whether he was a man, and not rather ſomething inferiour to a man? Would not this rather be a ſport than a temptation? But it would be much more ridiculous by any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whatſoever, to go about to perſwade the Son of God, begotten out of the divine Eſſence, that he ſhould doubt whether he be the Son of God or not.</p>
                  <p>But you will underſtand that thing is far otherwiſe, if you obſerve that Chriſt was pronounced by God, to be his Son in ſuch a manner as did not belong to his Eſſence, and which was indeed grounded on the divine Love, and therein chiefly conſiſted, that he was already deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the Meſſias, or heavenly or eternal King of the People of God, ſuch an one as he after actually became. For you will eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that this moſt cunning enemy did not fight ſo fooliſhly, when he called that in queſtion, and that there was no need of a buckler to receive his weapons. I at preſent omit other things, which occur in that Hiſtory of the temptation of Chriſt, as that Satan having brought him into a moſt high Mountain, ſhewed him all the Kingdoms of this World, and the glory thereof, as not ſufficiently known, or not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently obſerved by his eye, to the end that he might the more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allure him to worſhip the Devil, and that he durſt to ſay before him to this very end, <hi>All this power will I give</hi>

                     <hi>thee, and the glory thereof, for they are delivered to me, and to whom I will, I give them.</hi> For it is apparent, that Satan underſtood well enough, that he had not to do with the moſt high God, but with him, who in reſpect of his Eſſence, was a Man, but out of the ſingular Love of God was his Son; whom becauſe God had of his own accord, offered to him to be tempted, to the end he might give a proof of his Vertue and Piety; he thought it not altogether impoſſible, by his arts, to draw him from God.

                     <head>The Defence of the Argument.</head>
                     <p>NEither may any one ſay, that theſe things which we have dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from this Hiſtory, do therefore not follow, becauſe Chriſt was tempted according to his humane Nature only, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his divine Nature. For to omit the repetition of other things, that have formerly been often ſpoken, the ſame ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities will ſtill follow, although you hold that Satan tempted the humane Nature only, but perſonally united to the moſt high God, and joyned by an indiſſolvable tye; and that God willed that this humane Nature ſhould be tempted. For it would have been unworthy of the moſt high God, to expoſe himſelf in a Nature perſonally united to him, to an impious and deteſtable Adverſary, that he might mock him and ſollicite him to his worſhip. For the humane Nature could do nothing, unleſs the divine did conſent thereunto. Wherefore Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſoliciting the humane Nature of Chriſt to worſhip him, ſhould to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether have ſollicited the divine Nature to conſent to ſo horrid a crime, and to permit it unto the humane Nature. Likewiſe it had been ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſluous, to ſhew, that a Nature perſonally united to the moſt high God, could endure and vanquiſh the temptation of Satan. For who could make any doubt concerning that matter? Whence it is alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that Satan could not have the leaſt hope to overcome it. For what? could Satan believe it poſſible, that the divine Nature ſhould ſo far forſake the humane, perſonally united to it, as to yield to him, and commit a moſt heinous offence, and ſo become lyable to eternal damnation? did not Satan perceive that he had to do, not only with the humane, but alſo with the divine Nature; and that this Nature was to be ſeduced, and the wickedneſs to be perſwaded to it, if the humane Nature ought to be overcome? What therefore remaineth, but to ſay, that Satan had no certain knowledge of that union of the humane Nature with the divine? but what? Did not Satan, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to oppoſe this very thing, that Jeſus was the Son of God, underſtand what theſe words did ſignifie? But, if the Opinion of the Adverſaries be true, they ſignifie, that the man Jeſus is one Perſon with the ſon of God, eternally begotten out of the ſubſtance of God. Who would believe, if, as the Adverſaries hold, the Incarnation of the Son, eternally b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But in a thing that is evident, there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no more to be ſpoken; only we will add this thing, that whereas
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64944:94"/> Satan intended to make Chriſt doubt, whether he were the Son of God, namely, that Son, whom he had a little before heard the divine voice, pronounce him to be, it is not ſuitable that he ſhould in his temptation paſs by that Nature of Chriſt, according to which he was the Son of God. But the Adverſaries hold this to be the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Wherefore they muſt renounce either this opinion, or this limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, whereby they reſtrain this temptation to the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>Now we do not conceive, that any diſcreet man will ſay, that this Argument is drawn from the teſtimony of the Devil, who is a lying ſpirit. For we, contrary to the intention of the Devils words, urge, that that very man, whom the Devil tempted, was and is the Son of God, a little before commended by the heavenly Voice in Baptiſm. Wherefore the Argument is not drawn from the teſtimony of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as if he had ſaid that very thing, we would have; but partly from the act of God, appointing Chriſt to be tempted, and expoſed to the ſnares of Satan; partly from the ſence, words and intention of Satan, as effect, which could not have come to paſs, unleſs our Opinion were true.</p>

                     <p>FOr whereas they commonly ſo expound the place, as if it were ſaid, that Chriſt was born before every creature; this, if it be ſo taken, as that Chriſt ſhould be wholly exempted out of the number of all Creatures, is done without any example, and contrary to the received uſe of ſpeaking in the holy Scripture, and in ordinary ſpeech.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64944:95"/> Which very thing, certain very learned men among the Adverſaries, have ſufficiently perceived. For <hi>John Piſcator,</hi> although he allow that Expoſition as Orthodox, doth notwithſtanding propoſe it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, whether a different Expoſition brought by him, be not genuine, namely, that we ſhould underſtand Chriſt to be called the Firſt-born of every Creature, becauſe he is the chief Heir of all things.

Which the greateſt part of the Adverſaries ſay is ſpoken of him according to the divine Nature, and is an open proof of that Nature. But that, which is equal, hath alwayes a different Eſſence from that to which it is equal; otherwiſe the ſame thing would be equal to it ſelf: whereas equals are relatives, and conſequently oppoſites. If therefore Chriſt be equal to God, and that as they imagine, in reſpect of Eſſence and eſſential Properties, the Eſſence of Chriſt muſt of neceſſity be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Eſſence of God.

Although the buſineſs may eaſily be decided by what we have diſputed concerning Chriſt.

And the reaſon hereof is manifeſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you conſider the thing it ſelf, or the opinion of the Adverſaries. For as to the thing it ſelf, how could it come to paſs, that Chriſt ſhould ſend the holy Spirit, and give him to men, if the holy Spirit were the moſt high God, and Chriſt were not ſo?

And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is manifeſt enough, why ſuch a conſequence is illegitimate; becauſe like things may proceed from diverſe cauſes, or be converſant about di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe objects, or exiſt in diverſe ſubjects, yea, the ſelf ſame works may proceed from diverſe cauſes, either coordinate, (as they ſpeak) and united among themſelves, or ſubordinate; whereof the one doth depend on the o her; or is ſubſervient thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.

Now they tempted the holy Spirit, becauſe they acted, as if they would try, whether the holy Spirit dwelling in the Apoſtles, or the Apoſtles themſelves, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the holy Spirit dwelling in them, would obſerve the deceit or not. Wherefore the forecited Interpreter, whom we praiſed before, who had ſo rendred the words, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>That thou ſhouldeſt deceive the holy Spirit,</hi> doth afterwards explain them in this manner: <hi>That thou ſhouldeſt endeavour to deceive the holy Spirit,</hi> that is, <hi>us the Apoſtles, in whom the Spirit worketh, and to whom he revealeth the things that are needful to the edification of the Church; and this is a Metonymie of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct.</hi> I do not now mention that explication of thoſe words wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>By theſe things it eaſily appeareth, that it cannot from this place be concluded, that the holy Spirit is God; ſince <hi>Peter</hi> doth in one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſpeak of the holy Ghoſt, of God in another.

                     <p>As for the ſecond place therefore, which is extant 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19, 20. the holy Spirit is not underſtood by the name of God but is openly diſtinguiſhed from him. For is not the holy Spirit here manifeſtly diſtinguiſhed from God, whileſt it is ſaid that they have him <hi>from God?</hi> He ſpeaketh alſo of the ſame God in the following words, <hi>Therefore gloryfie God in your body, &amp;c.</hi> Now, that the Apoſtle doth not ſpeak of the holy Ghoſt, even that is an argument, namely, that he ſpeaketh of him, to whom we, as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, have been bought with a price, but who did ever read that we were bought to the holy Spirit? that we were by Chriſt bought and invaſſeld to the Father, both the thing it ſelf ſpeaketh, and it will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily appear from theſe words of the Revelation, which are extant Chap. 5.9.10. chap 14.4. But if they ſay, that it is from thence proved, that the holy Spirit is God, becauſe we are his temple: for none but God hath a temple: firſt it will not follow, that the holy Spirit is here called God, and that openly, which is the thing now in debate; For the ſame Adverſaries are wont to alleage many places, from whence they endeavour to evince, that either the holy Spirit, or Chriſt is the moſt high God, where notwithſtanding both they themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and all ſee, that the name of God is not attributed to Chriſt or the holy Spirit. Again, a temple may be belonging not only to the moſt high God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What need is there, I ſay, to ſhew, that we are the temple of God, who is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the holy ſpirit, and by the interveining of him dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in us; and not rather of God, which is the very ſpirit himſelf dwelling in us, and inhabiting us as his temple, not by another perſon, as our Adverſaries would have it, but by himſelf? But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles knew, that it belongeth not to the ſupream deity, in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſubſtance to inhabite any temple whatſoever on the earth, and to dwell in the breaſts of men, but by his virtue and efficacy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do not conclude, that we are the temple of God, or that God abideth in us, becauſe the holy ſpirit that dwelleth in us, is the ſupream God, but becauſe the ſpirit of that God dwelleth in us, and was by him given to us. For if the ſpirit, or force and efficacy of any deity dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in any place, the very deity it ſelf is ſaid to dwell there, and that is the temple thereof, wherein his virtue hath as it were fixed his abode.</p>
                     <p>The third place which is extant, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.5, 6. doth likewiſe plainly prove the contrary, for there <hi>one and the ſame ſpirit</hi> is manifeſtly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed both from <hi>one</hi> and the ſame <hi>God,</hi> and from <hi>one</hi> and the ſame <hi>Lord,</hi> of which matter we have<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>In like manner neither doth the fourth place, which is extant 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.2. prove that the holy Spirit is God, but rather, that he is not ſo; ſo far is he from being there openly called God or the Lord. For he is there openly diſtinguiſhed from the Lord, which is that one God, whilſt he is called the Spirit of the Lord, of which matter more in the<note n="*" place="margin">Below, Chap. <hi>5.</hi>

                        </gap>cious this reaſoning is; in that it conſiſteth of meer affirmatives in the ſecond figure, as they ſpeak in the ſchooles. For if ſuch an argument is to be admitted, we may thus alſo conclude; God the Father ſpake by <hi>David:</hi> The holy ſpirit ſpake by <hi>David:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy ſpirit is God the Father. For the <hi>Major</hi> is to be granted by the Adverſaries, both for the communion of operations, which they hold to be among the perſons of the Trinity, and alſo for the ſaying of the holy ſcripture. For that I may produce but on place; the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.25. ſay of God the Father, <hi>that he ſpake by the mouth of David his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> namely by the holy ſpirit, as the vulgar tranſlation hath it. But that God the Father is there underſtood, is apparent from verſ. 27. where Jeſus is called the ſon of that God, whom the Apoſtles ſpake unto. And indeed God ſpake by his Spirit, or the intervening of his Spirit by <hi>David,</hi> in that by his Spirit and effica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y he diſcloſed to him thoſe things, which he ought to ſpeak, and moved him to utter them. Thus in <hi>Rev. Chap.</hi> 2. and 3. at the end of every Epiſtle directed to the Angels of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, theſe words are read; <hi>Let him that hath an ear, hear what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches.</hi> But in theſe Epiſtles Chriſt the ſon of God doth perpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ually ſpeak. Wherefore if we ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the reaſoning of the adverſaries, we muſt conclude that that Spirit, namely, the holy Spirit, is Chriſt the ſon of God. Indeed Chriſt did there ſpeak, but by his Spirit, to whom for that reaſon the act of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is likewiſe there attributed. Now if the adverſaries will invert their major propoſition, and argue in this manner; whoſoever ſpake by <hi>David</hi> he is the God of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> neither that propoſition will be contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the place quoted, from whence the Argument is drawn, nor is to be admitted, unleſs it be thus taken: Whatſoever perſon principally ſpake by <hi>David,</hi> he is the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But if you ſubſume: The holy Spirit is a principal perſon ſpaking by <hi>David;</hi> it likewiſe will neither be contained in the place that was quoted, nor is at any hand to be granted. But again, <hi>David</hi> ſpaketh there one way concerning God, another concerning the holy Spirit. Of the Spirit he ſaith: The Spirit of the Lord ſpake <hi>by me;</hi> but of God he ſaith, The God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſpake <hi>to me;</hi> neither is it ſpoken of the ſame thing in both places.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64944:99"/> Wherefore in this matter, God did not ſpake by <hi>David,</hi> but by others to <hi>David.</hi> Howbeit, that this was performed by the Spirit of God, this, as to the force of thoſe words, is altogether by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.

                     <p>It is now eaſie to give an anſwer to thoſe places likewiſe, whereby others endeavour to prove, that the holy Spirit is called Lord. For that in none of them it is plainly written, that the holy Spirit is the Lord or God, which that it was requiſite to overthrow our Argument, every man perceiveth. But neither do they prove that the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is Lord.

For if they ſhould by that Particle, be wholly excluded from the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of bringing the People out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> we muſt conclude, either that <hi>Moſes</hi> did not lead that people, which notwithſtanding the Hiſtory doth moſt openly ſhew; or, that he alſo is the Lord himſelf.

But it is well that the very words of the place do ſhew, that the Particle <hi>alone</hi> is indeed oppoſed to <hi>other Gods,</hi> and perſons not ſubordinate to the Lord; in which number the holy Spirit is, which dwelling chiefly in <hi>Moſes,</hi> led the people, as may be underſtood from that place of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> chap. 63.11. which hath been cited. Now that this Spirit is not the Lord himſelf, who is ſaid alone to have led the People, is thence apparent, becauſe in theſe very words of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which are compared with that place of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> he is diſtinguiſhed from the Lord, whilſt he is called the Spirit of the Lord: and afterward the Prophet turning of his ſpeech unto the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſaith, <hi>Thus didſt thou lead thy People.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the other reaſon: The Lord ſaid, that he would ſpeak by the Prophets; but the holy Spirit ſpake by the Prophets; wherefore the holy Spirit is the Lord, An anſwer hereunto is already evident from thoſe things which have been ſpoken concerning that place, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.2. for it is a Syllogiſm of mere Affirmatives in the ſecond Figure. And if this reaſon be firm, it will follow, that the Angels alſo are the Lord. For in the quoted place, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.6. the Lord ſaith, that he would in viſion appear to the Prophets, or would ſpeak unto them by dreams. But the Angels alſo did this, as appeareth both from other places, ſo eſpecially from the Prophecy of <hi>Ezekiel, Daniel, Zachary,</hi> and from the Revelation of <hi>John.</hi> See <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.16, 17. &amp; 9.21, <hi>&amp;c. cap.</hi> 10.5, <hi>&amp;c. Zach.</hi> 1.8, 9, 14, 19. &amp; 2.1, 3, &amp;c. &amp; 4.1, &amp;c. &amp; frequently in other places; <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.1.17.1, &amp;c. and 19.9, 10. and 21.9, &amp;c. and 22.8, &amp;c. and ver. 16. Moreover, we have examples hereof in the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, and in the Acts of the Apoſtles. And that we may not go far from the places which the Adverſaries alleage; that very perſon, who ſpake
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64944:100"/> theſe words to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 4.12. was an Angel ſuſtaining the perſon of God, as we have elſewhere<note n="*" place="margin">See the Book of God and his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</note> ſhewn; and although a man would not confeſs it, yet ſeeing the Law is ſaid to have been diſpoſed, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by<note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19.</note> Angels, in the hand of a Mediator, he muſt needs confeſs, that the Angel, in giving the Law, ſpake unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> of whom thoſe words, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. do treat.</p>
                     <p>There is the ſame fault in the third reaſon, namely, that a concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in the ſecond Figure drawn out of mere Affirmatives: The Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites provokt the Lord; the Iſraelites provokt the holy Spirit; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy Spirit is the Lord. Which is refuted by that very place of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which is cited, whilſt he is ſaid to be the Spirit of the Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> for he ſaith, <hi>but they provoked to anger, and grieved the holy Spirit of him;</hi> that is, of the Lord, for of him it is ſpoken; ſee ver. 7, &amp;c. A like Argument hereunto would be this; The Iſraelites were diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Lord, and exaſperated him; The Iſraelites were diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the voice of the Lord, and exaſperated his mouth; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the voice of the Lord, or his mouth, are the Lord himſelf. Or thus; The Iſraelites grieved the holy Spirit, and reſiſted him. The Iſraelites grieved <hi>Moſes,</hi> and reſiſted him, as the Hiſtory teſtifieth in ſundry places; yea, they did chiefly ſo far forth grieve the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and reſiſt him in the wilderneſs, as they grieved <hi>Moſes,</hi> in whom he dwelt, and reſiſted him. Whence it will follow, if the Argument of the Adverſaries be right, that <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf was the holy Spirit. For it is to be obſerved, that the words, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.8, 9. are not ſo attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the holy Spirit, as if they were ſpoken in his perſon, as the Adverſaries conceive, but becauſe they were pronounced by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of the holy Spirit. Otherwiſe it would follow, that the holy Spirit is <hi>David</hi> himſelf, ſince the holy Spirit is in this place ſaid to have uttered alſo theſe words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. <hi>To day if you will hear his voice,</hi> namely, God, &amp;c. But it is certain, that both theſe words, and alſo the reſt, which are read in the beginning of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in the perſon of <hi>David.</hi> Thus we ſaw before, that it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the holy Spirit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.3. that he ſpake thoſe things which are moſt openly pronounced in the perſon of Chriſt. Therefore the holy Spirit ſo ſpake thoſe words in <hi>David,</hi> as he is ſaid to cry in our hearts, <hi>Abba Father,</hi> Gal. 4 6. namely, becauſe we by him, that is, by his impulſe, do ſo cry, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. and as he is ſaid to intercede for us with groans unutterable, ver. 26. becauſe he maketh us to pray and groan unto God.</p>
                     <p>As to the laſt proof; therefore the words of God are attributed in <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah,</hi> to the holy Spirit, becauſe <hi>Iſaiah</hi> pronounced them by the impulſe of the holy ſpirit. Now as it doth not follow, becauſe <hi>Iſaiah</hi> likewiſe pronounced thoſe words, that they are therefore ſpoken in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſo that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is the Lord; ſo likewiſe neither is it to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, concerning the holy Spirit, by whoſe impulſe he pronounced them. It is alſo here to be obſerved, what we noted in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. it is not ſaid of the holy Spirit, that he ſpake thoſe words <hi>unto Iſaiah,</hi> but only <hi>by Iſaiah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> But the Lord did not only ſpeak them by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:64944:100"/> but alſo, as appeareth by the Prophecy it ſelf, <hi>to Iſaiah;</hi> becauſe he ſpake openly by him, as one perſon doth to another; which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here nor elſewhere attributed to the holy Spirit. For if the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit is read to have ſaid any thing to any one, it is found to have no otherwiſe come to paſs, than, becauſe ſomethings were declared to ſome one from God, by the intervening of ſome Prophet. For in that the Prophets ſpake by divine Inſpiration; therefore the holy Spirit is ſaid to have ſpoken by them. But when God ſpaketh open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to any one, or an Angel ſuſtaining his perſon, the holy Spirit is not ſaid to have ſpoken to him. And thus much concerning our firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>

                        <hi>The ſecond Argument,</hi> That it is no where in holy Scripture commanded, that we ſhould adore, or invocate the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; yea, there is not ſo much as any example there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>LEt the next Argument be this, that we are no where either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, or any way admoniſhed in the holy Scripture, to adore or invocate the holy Spirit. Yea, ſo far it is, that there is any precept or admonition concerning this thing, that there is not ſo much as one example of any man there to be found, which hath done it. Now though it is ſaid in that which is called the Apoſtles Creed, that we are to believe in the holy Spirit: as many of the Antients did in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſay, that we are to believe in the Catholick Church, and in the other things that are there mentioned; yet is it no where expreſly ſaid in the holy Scripture, that we ought to believe in the holy Spirit, or that any one did believe in him. But, were the holy Spirit the moſt, high God, how could it be, that all thoſe things ſhould not be openly enjoyned, and many examples of them found in holy men? firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe things would be neceſſary to be known and practiſed of all men to ſalvation, were the holy Spirit the moſt high God. Again, becauſe theſe things are not only often, but moſt openly writ concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Father; but alſo concerning the Son, there are partly precepts, partly admonitions, and very many examples, although we have ſhewn that he is not the moſt high God. How much more therefore would there be many examples extant concerning the holy Spirit, were he the moſt high God.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Scripture ſpeaks nothing of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note>INdeed the Adverſaries endeavour ſometimes a by certain conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to evince that theſe things are ſome way contained in the holy Scripture, but here we ſhall not deal with conſequences, but as we have taught, with open precepts, that might be evident to every one, though otherwiſe he were but a ſimple man.</p>
                     <p>As for Invocation, ſome imagine they have an example thereof, both in <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi> who wiſheth to the <hi>Corinthians, The communion of the holy Spirit:</hi> and alſo in <hi>John Rev.</hi> 1.4. who wiſheth to the ſeven <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, <hi>Grace and peace to the ſeven Spirits that are before the Throne of God.</hi> But they are exceedingly miſtaken; for as to the wiſh of <hi>Paul,</hi> it is one thing to wiſh that the communion of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhould be with men; another thing to invocate the holy Spirit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for the firſt is no other than to wiſh, that the holy Spirit ſhould be communicated unto men, or being cummunicated, ſhould abide with them. For neither doth the Apoſtle take the communion of the holy Spirit actively, as if he wiſhed that the holy Spirit ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate ſomething; otherwiſe he would have added the name of ſomething which he would have to be communicated to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> by the holy Spirit; but as we have already hinted paſſively. Thus the communion of the Blood of Chriſt, and the communion of the Body of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. is taken, where there is the ſame word in the Greek, as in that place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi> For whilſt the Apoſtle wiſheth the communion of the holy Spirit to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth in what manner chiefly he deſireth that God and Chriſt ſhould teſtifie their Grace and Love towards them, namely, in giving his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit to them, or in cheriſhing and augmenting the ſame already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto them, And indeed it would be a wonder, if <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould here wiſh for ſomething from the holy Spirit, as a divine perſon, that he ſhould ſo often have omitted the mention of him elſewhere in the like prayers. Of which matter more hereafter.</p>
                     <p>As to the wiſh of <hi>John,</hi> the very number of thoſe ſpirits ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinteth, that this place maketh nothing to the invocation of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, whom they would have to be the third Perſon in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. For then we ſhould make ſeven ſpirits inſtead of one, ſo that for three Perſons of the Deity, we ſhould have nine. Which, when others perceived, they ſaid, that by theſe ſpirits, is to be underſtood the various power of God, or, as they ſpeak, the various gift of the holy Spirit. And therefore it is all one, as if <hi>John</hi> ſhould pray for Grace and Peace from the holy Spirit himſelf. But beſides that, the Adverſaries agree not among themſelves concerning this matter (for ſome by that name underſtand ſeven chief Angels of God; others the manifold providence of God and Chriſt) what is there that evinceth, that this vertue proceedeth from the holy Spirit, which is a third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Deity? and that he is invocated, when <hi>John</hi> prayeth for
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64944:101"/> Grace and Peace from thoſe ſeven Spirits of God? There is not the leaſt hint thereof in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> where mention is ſeveral times made of thoſe ſeven ſpirits. See beſides the very place of the firſt chapter, chap. 3.1. &amp; 4.5. &amp; 5.6. which two places compare with <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.2, 10. from whence they are in a manner taken. In theſe places thou ſhalt ſee thoſe ſpirits called the ſpirits <hi>of God,</hi> they are ſaid to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne. Chriſt is ſaid to have them as eyes and horns. For they are to him inſtead of eyes, becauſe by them he overſeeth and taketh care of his Diſciples, and provideth for them; and inſtead of horns, becauſe by them he puſheth his enemies, and driveth them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and chaſeth them from his People. What hint is here of the holy Spirit, that ſhould be a third Perſon of the Deity? Doth not the thing it ſelf ſhew, that if the manifold vertue and efficacy of God which he hath communicated with Chriſt, be to be underſtood, <hi>John,</hi> whilſt he wiſheth grace and peace from thoſe ſpirits, doth ſo mention them, as if they were certain perſons diſtinct from God and Chriſt; yet in the mean time, doth only declare the means &amp; manner whereby he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth that grace &amp; peace ſhould proceed from God to the Churches? and ſo doth tacitly repeat the invocation of God himſelf, whom he had before named, and whoſe ſpirits they principally are, and to whom they do in a manner miniſter? for which reaſon alſo he immediately ſubjoyneth them to God. But for as much as Chriſt alſo hath theſe ſpirits of God, and maketh uſe of them, therefore having made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, he alſo commemmorateth Chriſt, and prayeth for grace and peace to the Churches from him; wherefore this wiſh, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring of the divine help comprehended therein, is properly refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to God and Chriſt, improperly to the ſpirits themſelves. Which is the cauſe why other divine men omit the mention of them in their ſalutations and wiſhes: they who hold them to be Angels, will ſay that this invocation, is referred to them only in a ſecondary manner, as unto Miniſters, not as unto Lords, and the true beſtowers of grace and peace; and that therefore the mention of them is elſewhere o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and they are therefore ſet before Chriſt, partly becauſe they belong unto God, to whom they are next ſubjoyned (for which cauſe alſo afterwards, chap. 3. the name of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> is interpoſed betwixt that of God and Chriſt) partly becauſe <hi>John</hi> intendeth to ſpeak more largely of Chriſt. For he therefore reſerveth the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them to the end, that without diſturbing the courſe of his ſpeech, he might more freely make an excurſion into his prayers. For if he would have reſerved the mention of thoſe ſpirits to the end, he ſhould have either uſed a longer Parentheſis, or begun a new ſpeech. It is apparent therefore that there is nothing in thoſe places, to eſtabliſh the invocation of the holy Spirit. And here it is worth the rehearſing, (as learned men have noted) that <hi>Hilary</hi> in his twelve Books concerning the Trinity, never called the holy Spirit God, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaid that he is to be adored, but only to be obtained: which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be obſerved in other Writers both of that and former times. Yea, the true opinion concerning the holy Spirit, was of ſo great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64944:102"/> that even after thoſe things, wherein the holy Spirit began to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for the moſt hlgh God, almoſt all the prayers of the Churches were directed to God the Father, and to Chriſt, not to the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And there are yet extant, ſeveral Books of the Papiſts, put forth in the former age, and containing an account of Religion and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in uſe among them, where it is expreſly declared, that we muſt obſerve how every prayer is directed to God the Father, or to Chriſt, the Son, and not to the holy Spirit, becauſe a gift is not asked from the gift it ſelf, but from the beſtower of the gift. Indeed we are not ignorant, that there is an uſual Hymn among them, wherein they pray the holy Spirit to come, and fill the heart of his People; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, the cauſe which is alleaged, that a gift is not asked from the gift it ſelf, but from the beſtower of the gift, is univerſal, and it is clear that regard was had thereunto in moſt prayers of the Church, and ſhould have been had in all without exception. Now that cuſtom of praying, is an open token of the true Opinion, which did at firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in the Church. For if the holy Spirit be the moſt high God, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely equal to the Father, and to the Son, whom they likewiſe hold to be the moſt high God, why was he not judged worthy of equal honour? why were either all, or at leaſt the greateſt part of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers not equally directed to him, as to the Father or the Son? This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was the hinderance, that in thoſe firſt times, it was out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie; as both the holy Scripture doth plainly enough teſtifie, and at this day many (though therein inconſtant to themſelves) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that the holy Spirit is a gift. For which cauſe <hi>Hilary,</hi> before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, illuſtrating and confirming his opinion concerning the Trinity, with that ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Baptiſing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Spirit,</hi> doth in his ſecond Book concerning the Trinity, at the cloſe thereof, thus explain the words, <hi>In the confeſſion of the Author, and of the only Begotten, and of the gift,</hi> which he doth there largely purſue. Wherefore ſince they had this opinion concerning the holy Spirit, they directed their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers not to him, but to the Father and the Son, the beſtower of that gift; knowing, that a gift is not asked from the gift it ſelf, but from the giver of the gift. Which cuſtom, even the contrary errour hath for ſo many ages not been able quite to aboliſh.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THe third Argument may thence be drawn, that in very many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Scripture, where mention is made of the Father, and of the Son, and ſometimes of Angels, or other things, and perſons, there is no mention made of the holy Spirit; when nevertheleſs men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to have been made of him, no leſs than of the Father and the Son; and rather then of the Angels, or of other things and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, if he were the moſt high God, coequal (as they ſpeak) to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son. Which that it may be plain, we will firſt alleage thoſe places, wherein there is mention made of the Father, and of Chriſt only; and then thoſe where mention is made of others, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons, and chiefly Angels, or things, which ought to have been mentioned much leſs than the holy Spirit, if he had been the moſt high God. But for as much as the places of the former ſort are almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, we will here recite thoſe only, which are ſomewhat more illuſtrious, and ſuch chiefly, as affirm the ſame thing of God and Chriſt within the compaſs of the ſame ſentence; the reſt we reſerve for the diligence of the Reader.</p>
                  <p>We will begin from <hi>John;</hi> in the Hiſtory of whoſe Goſpel, we will give the firſt place to thoſe words of Chriſt, which are extant chap. 17.3. <hi>This is Life eternal, that they know thee</hi> (Father) <hi>the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> We do not now urge, that the Father only is ſaid, to be the true God; for that we have done in the<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 1.</note> beginning of this work; but that mention is made of the Father only, and of the Son, and in the knowledge of theſe two only, eternal life, or the way to attain it, is placed: when notwithſtanding, were the holy Spirit no leſs the true God than the Father, it would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that eternal Life ſhould lye no leſs in the knowledge of him, than in the knowledge of the Father; and conſequently mention ſhould have been made no leſs of the one than of the other; much leſs that a divine Embaſſadour ſhould rather be mentioned. Neither can the Adverſaries ſay, that the knowledge of the holy Spirit, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the knowledge of the Father, and of Chriſt. For though this be otherwiſe moſt true, yet is it of no force to weaken our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. For the knowledge of the holy Spirit is contained in the knowledge of God and Chriſt; but not as of a perſon diſtinct from God the Father, and from Chriſt; but as of a divine thing to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto men from the Father by the Son. For otherwiſe the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:64944:103"/> knowledge of Chriſt is alſo oftentimes included in the knowledge<note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Col</hi> 1.10. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3 <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.18. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2, 3 4, 13. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.6.</note> of God; and on the contrary, the knowledge of God is comprized in the knowledge of<note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Col</hi> 1.10. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3 <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.18. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2, 3 4, 13. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.6.</note> Chriſt; namely, becauſe he that knoweth and ſeeth Chriſt, knoweth and ſeeth the Father, <hi>John</hi> 8.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.7, 9. And on the contrary, none knoweth the Father, nor cometh to him, but by the Son, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27. <hi>John</hi> 14.6. So that it is neceſſary, if a man will attain the ſaving knowledge of the Father, that he know the Son alſo. Nevertheleſs, Chriſt in that place of ours, was not content to make mention either of the Father alone, or of himſelf alone, but joyned the knowledge of both together, becauſe his intention was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs thoſe divine perſons, in the knowledge of whom eternal Life conſiſteth. If therefore the holy Spirit were a divine perſon, diſtinct from the Father and the Son, he would no leſs have mentioned him than thoſe two perſons, ſeeing the obtaining of eternal Life would conſiſt no leſs in the knowledge of him, than of them.</p>
                  <p>But now let us proceed to other things, and becauſe we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun from <hi>John,</hi> let us add other paſſages, which are extant in the ſame writer, partly in his Hiſtory of the Goſpel, partly in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and partly in the Revelation. As for the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, among other paſſages, Chriſt ſpaketh thus, chap. 8.16, &amp;c. (which place we have upon another<note n="*" place="margin">

Did he contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute leſs to the truth of Chriſts judgment, than the Father, although-he were one God with him? Did he leſs give teſtimony to Chriſt? why therefore did he not mention his teſtimony, ſeeing the plurality of witneſſes moſt worthy of credit, addeth greater weight to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony; and here Chriſt urgeth both the number and dignity of the witneſſes?

And indeed his teſtimony may peculiarly be recited, although he be not a divine perſon diſtinct from the Father and the Son; namely, becauſe the teſtimony which God gave to Chriſt by him, had ſomething peculiar from the reſt; ſo that he doth ſeem in a manner to teſtifie a part from both; but there can no cauſe be brought, why his teſtimony was omitted, if he be a divine perſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Father and the Son: but if he be the vertue and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God the Father, his teſtimony is rightly comprehended in the teſtimony of the Father, as it cometh to paſs in the ſame chapter of

                  <p>Now that we may come to the Epiſtle of the ſame Apoſtle; what is that which is read 1 Epiſt. 1.3. <hi>Our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> why is it not added alſo, <hi>with the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> if he be a divine perſon diſtinct from both, and yet equal in all things to both, yea, one God with both?

What is that 2 Epiſt. ver. 3. <hi>Grace be with you, Mercy and Peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of the Father?</hi> why not alſo from the holy Spirit? Concerning which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we will afterward ſpeak more, when we rehearſe the ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Paul.</hi> Add to theſe the words of ver. 9. in the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>He that abideth in the Doctrine of Chriſt, he hath both the Father and the Son:</hi> why not alſo the holy Spirit?</p>
                  <p>As for the Revelation; to omit thoſe places, wherein other things or perſons are joyned with God and Chriſt, which are afterward to be rehearſed by us; how famous is that place, chap. 5.13. where all the Creatures which are in any place, are read to have ſaid, <hi>Bleſſing, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Glory and Power be unto him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever?</hi> why not (as now a dayes all the Temples of the Adverſaries do ring) glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the holy Spirit? why only to him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb?

                  <p>Now that we may come to other ſacred Writers; what is more clear than thoſe ſalutations of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> which are extant in the beginning of all his Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But why doth not <hi>Paul</hi> ſo much as once wiſh grace and peace to the Faithful from the holy Spirit? Was his grace leſs neceſſary to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, though he were the moſt high God? or, was he leſs the Author of that peace or felicity, which <hi>Paul</hi> wiſhed to the Faithful, or leſs worthy, to whom he ſhould expreſly give the honour of invocation, then God the Father of Chriſt? Certainly even this alone ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh every man, that he ſhould not think of any third perſon of the Deity.</p>
                  <p>Now, that the ſame <hi>Paul</hi> doth elſewhere pray for the communion of the holy Spirit, that, as we have ſeen in the former chapter, maketh nothing to the invocation of the holy Spirit.

                  <p>Now, let us ſhew that other things are wont to be joyned with God and Chriſt, whilſt the name of the holy ſpirit is omitted. For this we have a notable place in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> out of which we have before alleaged many teſtimonies; namely, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.12. where Chriſt promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a reward to him that overcometh in theſe words, <hi>I will write up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the name of my God, and the name of the City of my God, new Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, which cometh down out of Heaven from my God, and my new name.</hi> Where you ſee, that between God and Chriſt, or rather the name of both, the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the name of it is interpoſed.

We will ſhut up all our proofes with that famous place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23, 24. where not only Angels are joyned with God and Chriſt, but alſo pious men, partly alive, partly dead, or their ſpirits, and certain other ſacred things, to which Chriſt hath given an acceſs unto Chriſtians, but the mention of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is altogether omitted.

But he was no where mentioned unleſs there, where mention is made of <hi>God the Judge of all.</hi> Neither may any one ſay, that the Father indeed is underſtood, yet not he alone, but alſo the holy Spirit. For if more perſons were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, the perſon of Chriſt, no leſs than that of the holy Spirit, ought to be included in that name, according to the opinion of the Adverſaries, touching the perſons of the Deity. But the perſon of Chriſt the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64944:106"/> is openly diſtinguiſhed from that God, as being afterwards menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned apart.

                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome one will perhaps object, That, if the reaſon drawn from this place were of force, it would not only follow, that the holy Spirit is no perſon, but alſo no ſacred or divine thing, ſuch as we ſee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>us Chriſt, namely, of immortality and remiſſion of ſins, there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs mention made; but only the place thereof is figuratively mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, namely, Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the middle effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe thereof, namely Chriſt the Mediator of the new Covenant, and the ſprinkling of Blood, which ſpeaketh better things than that of <hi>Abel;</hi> and the prime efficient cauſe of both even God. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, neither was the holy Spirit mentioned, which is contained among the good things, which are promiſed to us. Namely, becauſe he would reckon up all the perſons, with whom we have ſome conjunction &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion by right of the Chriſtian religion; ſo that we may be rightly ſaid to have acceſs unto them: but the divine author intended to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only thoſe ſacred and divine things, which are in ſome ſort with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, and elegantly anſwer, and are in ſome ſort oppoſed to thoſe things to which the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had heretofore acceſs, when the Law was given them out of Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> the Mediator. But in this number is not the divine efficacy or virtue which floweth from God to us, and is ſent into our hearts, ſo neither the remiſſion of ſins and immortality. But were the holy Spirit a perſon, we had come to him no leſs than to the Father, and ſhould have intimate communion and ſociety with him; neither could he by any means be omitted in ſo large and accurate an enumeration of thoſe perſons with whom we have conjunction.

                  </argument>
                  <p>VVE have hitherto alleaged teſtimonies enough, wherein the mention of the holy Spirit is omitted; but ought not to be omitted if he were a divine perſon. We will now ſubjoyne one place, that is different from the former teſtimonies, and more like to them, wherein ſomething is expreſly denyed of the holy ſpirit. Becauſe though it make not expreſs mention of the holy Spirit, yet doth it in general deny ſomething of him, that could not be denyed, were he a divine perſon, diſtinct from the Father and the Son, and equal unto both. This place is extant <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. where Chriſt ſpeaketh thus: <hi>None know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Son, but the Father, neither knoweth any one the Father, ſave the Son,</hi> &amp;c. But how could this be true were the holy Spirit a divine perſon, diſtinct from the Father and the Son, and in all things equal unto both? for ſome other beſides the Father, would have known the Son; and ſome other beſides the Son would have known the Father, namely, the holy Spirit; Yea he would have known him without the revelation of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>Neither can it be here ſaid, that the word <hi>none</hi> is put onely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude creatures. For otherwiſe why is it added, <hi>ſave the Father?</hi> Why is he excepted? Is he haply ranked among the creatures, ſo that he was there expreſly to be excepted? For that only is excepted, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe is comprehended under the general name, and which, had it not been excepted, might be thought to have been comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There is the ſame difficulty concerning the Son, if you conſider the opinion of the adverſaries. For they hold him, as he is the Son of God, to be no creature. But here he is lookt upon as he is the Son. Neither may any one ſay, that the holy Spirit is tacitly included in the Father and the Son. For if the holy Spirit be a perſon diſtinct from both, by what right is this affirmed? Again, is the holy Spirit more included in the Father and the Son, than either the Son in the Father, or contrarywiſe, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Son? Certainly no more. Wherefore if no mention be made of the holy Spirit, becauſe he is included in both, there ought to be no expreſs mention made either of the Son, or of the Father, becauſe the one is included in the other. And truly the mention of the Father do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t from both; yea there is not ſo much as any ſuſpicion, that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64944:107"/> he is included. But there the very names have a mutual relation each to other. Wherefore mention ſhould rather have been made of the holy Spirit, than either of the Father, when it is ſpoken concering the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Son; or of the Son, when it is ſpoken concerning the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Father.</p>
                  <p>Finally, neither may any, one ſay, that the holy Spirit is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended among them, to whom the Son will reveal, the Father or himſelf; becauſe he beſtoweth on him, as the Eſſence, ſo alſo the knowledge of the Father. For to omit, that nothing is revealed to any one, unleſs he doth already exiſt; it is here ſpoken of ſuch a revelation, as happeneth at a certain time, and dependeth on the will of the Son, and not on the neceſſity of nature. But that revelation, if it ought to have ſuch a name, as it is cauſed by the proceſſion of the holy Spirit from the Eſſence of the Son, is conceived both to have been from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not to depend on the will of the ſon, but on the neceſſity of nature. Doth not the thing it ſelf intimate, that men are here underſtood to whom Chriſt is willing to deliver the knowledge of the Father by the doctrine of the Goſpel. Though further, this very thing that is affirmed in this exception, demonſtrateth the holy ſpirit not to be the moſt high God. For he is not the moſt high God, who receiveth his Eſſence, and whatſoever he hath from another: but he who hath that from himſelf, as we have taught in our<note n="*" place="margin">

And they are of two ſorts; For ſome are ſuch, as being properly taken, agree no more to perſons, than to other things, or alſo at no hand agree to perſons, but are only proper to things: But ſome are ſuch, as taken properly, agree to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only; but are aſcribed to the holy Spirit by a certaine figure.

We have above likewiſe ſeen other places out of the ſame Epiſtle, where the holy ſpirit is in another manner diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from God, chap. 6.19. and chap. 12.4, 5, 6. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. laſt: which places are wont to be alledged by the Adverſaries, to ſhew, that the holy ſpirit is a divine perſon. But in a manifeſt thing, no more proofs are needfull. Now we have reckoned up thoſe places of the ſcripture cheifly, wherein the adverſaries do either confeſs, that it is ſpoken concerning the very perſon of the holy ſpirit, or alſo urge it leaſt any one ſhould contend, that it is ſpoken only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the gift proceeding from the ſame perſon, and that it only, but not the holy ſpirit properly ſo called, is termed the ſpirit of God: concerning which diſtinction we will treat in the following Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THe ſecond Argument of this rank, but the ſixth of this Section, ſhall be this, that the holy Spirit is the power or efficacy of God, namely, (that we may explain it by t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e by) which proceedeth from God, and iſſuing unto men, doth ſanctifie and conſecrate them, and produce various and admirable effects in them: which power they are wont to call divine inſpiration; but the power and efficacy of God, can at no rate be the moſt high God, or a perſon of ſupream Deity; as ſhall better be underſtood in the Defence of this Argument.</p>
                  <p>But even our Adverſaries, who are a little more verſed in the holy Scripture, are aware, that the holy Spirit is the power or efficacy of God. For among others, that place is very plain, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.49. where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>And I ſend the promiſe of my Father upon you: but abide ye in the City of Jeruſalem, until ye be endued with power from on high<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Where, by all Interpreters that I know, it is obſerved, that under the name of that power, with which the Apoſtles were to be endued, the holy Spirit is underſtood; and this was that Promiſe of the Father, from Chriſt to be ſent upon them. See among other places, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4, 5, 8. and 2.4, 33. Therefore this place alſo was brought, to illuſtrate thoſe other places, in which the holy Spirit is ſignifyed by the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the divine Power. It likes me to ſet down here the words of two moſt learned Interpreters of the holy Scripture, one a Papiſt, the other a Proteſtant, in their Annotations on <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. where the Angel ſaith to the Virgin <hi>Mary, The holy Spirit ſhall come upon thee, and the Power of the moſt high ſhall overſhadow thee.</hi> For the former<note n="*" place="margin">John Maldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat.</note> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, after he had ſaid, that <hi>Gregory, Chryſoſtome, Victor, Damaſcen, Beda, Theophilact,</hi> interpret the Power of the Moſt high, to be Chriſt, or the Son of God, adds, <q>Others think, that he whom before he called the holy Spirit, now is called the Power of the moſt high God; as <hi>Euthymius,</hi> whom I rather follow, though of leſs account, and the only Author, yet ſaying things more like truth than many, and thoſe of greater eſteem. For it is a repeating of the ſame ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, ſuch as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> chiefly in ſongs do frequently uſe, one ſentence concluding one verſe, which in the fore part of the verſe is expreſſed in ſome words, in the latter is repeated in other words, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.4. <hi>He that dwelleth in the heavens, ſhall deride them, and the Lord ſhall mock them.</hi> For in the ſame manner we ſee, the Angel a little before to have ſaid, <hi>Hail thou that art full of favour, the Lord is with thee,</hi> varying the words, the ſence being the ſame. And the holy Spirit is wont to be termed, as the <hi>Finger,</hi> ſo alſo the <hi>Power of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64944:109"/> God</hi> by the ſame ſimilitude; as beneath, chap. 24.49. <hi>But ſtay ye in the City, until ye be endued with Power from on high.</hi> Therefore Power and Spirit are wont moſt often to be coupled in the holy Scriptures; as below, chap. 4.14. and in <hi>Acts</hi> 10.38. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. and 15.13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.16. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. But the<note n="*" place="margin">John Piſcator.</note> latter ſo writes. And the Power of the moſt high, that is, the ſame holy Spirit, who is the Power proceeding from the Moſt High, that is, God the Father. A deſcription. For the ſame ſentence is repeated in other words by way of explication. So below, ver. 24.49. the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is named the Power from on high.</q> To them alſo, other moſt learned<note n="†" place="margin">See John Calvin.</note> men aſſent. For that many of the Antients have underſtood, the Son of God by the Power of the moſt high, that I repeat not the reaſon brought by a moſt learned Interpreter of the Papiſts, it is alſo refuted by other Arguments. Firſt, becauſe <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.20. where the Angel expreſſeth the ſame thing to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> he mentions only the holy Spirit; nor would he have left out the Son of God, if <hi>Gabriel</hi> had by name conjoyned him with the holy ſpirit in this place, and had made him Author of his own conception: ſeeing there was no greater cauſe of mentioning him here, than there. Moreover, becauſe by this means, Chriſt ſhould be made the ſon of himſelf, ſeeing in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 31:</note> 
                     <hi>Section,</hi> we have ſhewed that Chriſt was called the ſon of God, by reaſon of ſo wonderful a conception and generation.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps ſome other will ſay, that the Power of the Moſt High, in this place ſignifies, neither the ſon, nor the holy ſpirit: but the efficacy flowing from the holy ſpirit. For here two efficient Cauſes of the conception of Chriſt are mentioned; one the Perſon of the holy Spirit, the other his Power. But firſt, that reaſon which we now brought concerning the ſon, is againſt it, becauſe by this reaſon, the holy ſpirit ſhould be made the Father of Chriſt: of which by it ſelf, we ſhall afterward in the following chapter treat. Furthermore if any perſon here had been to be named beſides the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gin, was to cauſe the conception of Chriſt, the ſon had been to be named, whom the Adverſaries hold, to have deſcended from heaven into the Virgins womb, and there to have aſſumed humane fleſh. But we have already ſhewed, and it is laid down in this exception which we now refute, that the ſon was not named in the words of the Angel, as the Author of his conception. Laſtly, ſuch an opinion ſhould require, that that Power, of which in the words of the Angel there is mention, ſhould be called the power of the holy ſpirit, or by the name of the Moſt High, whoſe power he is ſaid to be, ſhould be underſtood the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit. But any one ſees the former was not done. The latter is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by refelled, becauſe, both by the following words, and alſo by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring with the 32d<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verſe, it ſufficiently appears, that by the words, <hi>The Moſt High,</hi> the Father of Jeſus Chriſt is underſtood. Wherefore this is another place, from whence it is proved, that the holy ſpirit is the divine power or efficacy.</p>
                  <p>The third place is extant in <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4, 5. where he ſaith, <hi>And
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64944:109"/> my ſpeech, and my preaching was not in the enticing words of mans wiſdom, but in demonſtration of the ſpirit, and of power, that your faith ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the Power of God.</hi> Where you ſee the Apoſtle, inſtead of that which he had before expreſſed in two words, <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> afterwards puts only the <hi>power of God.</hi> To which are to be added alſo thoſe words of <hi>Peter,</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 10.38. of Chriſt, <hi>how God anointed him with the holy Ghoſt, and with Power:</hi> and thoſe of the Angel, in <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17. of <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, <hi>And he ſhall go before him in the ſpirit and power of Elias.</hi> For the ſame thing in very deed is deſigned by the name of <hi>ſpirit,</hi> or <hi>holy ſpirit</hi> and <hi>power.</hi> Neither is it of moment, that ſome where the <hi>power of the holy ſpirit</hi> is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For both of power and efficacy, there may be again other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and efficacy depending on that former: And furthermore, it is to be obſerved, that the Genitive Caſe, <hi>of the holy ſpirit,</hi> may with good right be taken for the Genitive of the ſpecies. After which manner, both the <hi>gift of the holy ſpirit,</hi> is taken for that gift, which is the holy ſpirit, Acts 2.38. &amp; 10 45 comp. chap 11.15, 16, 17. and the <hi>earneſt of the ſpirit,</hi> for the earneſt which is the holy ſpirit, 2 Cor. 1.22. and 5 5. as both of it ſelf it is eaſily underſtood, as alſo by comparing with the words, Epheſ. 1.14. is perceived. So alſo the promiſe of the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Acts 2.33. is taken for the thing promiſed, which is the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. But there is no need of more examples, when frequently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough the Genitive Caſe put after another Noun, ſignifies its certain ſpecies, as it is obſerved by learned men.</p>
                  <p>To the places hitherto brought, the words, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.7, 20. may be added, in which, if in the place of divine power, you put the holy ſpirit, you will ſee, that there indeed will be no difference of the ſence: as alſo on the contrary, where mention is made of the holy ſpirit, if you put power, or divine efficacy, or divine inſpiration, there will ariſe no diverſity of meaning; although there, where the name of Power, as a genus, is put before it, the manner of ſpeaking is to be ſomewhat changed: or where that is added for explication ſake, it is not any more afterwards to be repeated. Thoſe words alſo of Chriſt in Luke, chap 11.20. may be added, in which he affirms, that by the <hi>Finger of God,</hi> he caſt out Devils. Where it is eaſily to be ſeen, that by the name <hi>of Finger,</hi> the power and efficacy of God is underſtood; as it alſo happens elſewhere<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. <hi>8.4.</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with, Exod <hi>8.19.</hi>
                     </note> in the holy Scripture: in which manner alſo the <hi>hand of God</hi> is taken. For therefore that by which God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms his Works, that is, his Power or Efficacy, is termed Hand or Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, becauſe we are wont to effect our works with hands and fingers; as others have long ſince obſerved. But Chriſt expreſſing the ſame thing in <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> 12 28. ſaith, that he caſt out Devils <hi>in the ſpirit of God:</hi> ſo that the Finger of God, or the Power and Efficacy, is the ſame with the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That the holy Spirit is the Power or Efficacy of God, thence appeareth, becauſe both prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ecies, and other admirable gifts and works, which come from that Power and Efficacy, which we are wont to call the divine Inſpiration, are all aſcribed to the holy Spirit, as to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:64944:110"/> the next cauſe, and inwardly working in men; and that not becauſe it is revealed by God, that the holy Spirit doth effect them, but becauſe it is from the thing it ſelf manifeſt enough, if it appeare that they are performed by a divine Power. See <hi>Luke.</hi> 1.41, 67. <hi>and</hi> 2.26, 27. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.8, 31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.10, 55. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.44, 45, 47. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.15, 16, 24, 28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13.2, 4, 9, 52. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.8, 28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.6, 7.20.23, 28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21.4, 11. and (that I may paſs by many more places of holy Scripture) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4, 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>ult.</hi> Whence alſo, when the divine Writers would ſignifie any one to be divinely inſpired, and filled with divine power, they ſay, that he is filled with the holy Spirit; or uſing ſome like manner of ſpeaking, affirm him to be endued with a divine Spirit. But if the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit were not the very Power and Efficacy of God, but a perſon diſtinct from the Father and Son, there would be no cauſe, why all thoſe things ſhould be aſcribed to the holy Spirit, as the next cauſe, and inwardly working in men. For as much as it might come to paſs, that the Father and the ſon by their Efficacy, might effect all thoſe things, the perſon of the holy ſpirit not intervening, as a middle cauſe. Certainly, although it ſhould be manifeſt, that propheſie, or any other gift, comes from God, nevertheleſs, it could not appear without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt divine revelation, that the holy ſpirit did intervene, as a middle and next cauſe, to perform that thing. But the holy ſcriptures do ſo ſpeak of that thing, that they plainly enough ſhew, that it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by the thing it ſelf without other peculiar revelation. Neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Paul,</hi> when writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he ſaid,<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.1.</note> his words were in demonſtration of ſpirit, to wit, divine: or among other things commended himſelf, as the ſervant of God<note n="†" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4.</note> 
                     <hi>in the holy Spirit;</hi> would at length be underſtood by his words, that he was endued with the holy Spirit, and that from it his words or deeds came, but from the thing it ſelf. But if you ſay, that therefore al thoſe things are aſcribed to the holy Spirit, and that thing was manifeſt to all believers, becauſe the holy ſpirit is God himſelf, from whom no man is ignorant all thoſe things come; he beſides that he ſhall take as granted the thing here controverted, and unknown to thoſe men, to whom <hi>Paul,</hi> for inſtance, chiefly would demonſtrate, that he ſpake by the ſpirit of God; alſo will not looſe the knot. For nether are thoſe works aſcribed, to the holy ſpirit in the ſame manner as to the Father, who is by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of all, the ſupream God: nor in that manner, by which they are aſcribed to the ſon, but, as alſo the Adverſaries themſelves in part confeſs, by a certain proper and peculiar manner; that is, as to the next cauſe, and inwardly working in men. And this is that, which the holy ſcriptures in the places before alleaged, and infinite other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, would have us underſtand. But concerning this thing, nothing ſhould be manifeſt from the works themſelves performed by divine power, if the holy ſpirit were that ſupream God; and yet in perſon diſtinct from the Father &amp; ſon. Yea, if the holy ſpirit were the ſupream God, it ſhould rather be concluded, that the holy ſpirit is not ſuch a cauſe of thoſe works. For it belongs not to the ſupream God, that perſonally inhabiting in men, he ſhould do any works in or by them,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64944:110"/> but that he inſpire Power and Efficacy to them, and by that means perform works to be admired in or by them.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>A larger Defence of the Argument.</head>
                     <p>SUfficiently, as it ſeems to us, we have hitherto confirmed our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Yet nevertheleſs, ſince two anſwers either are wont, or may ſeem to be made to it, they are to be refelled by us. The former is againſt the major Propoſition of the Argument, which by an inſtance, the Adverſaries endeavour to infringe. For they ſay, that Chriſt alſo is called the Vertue or Power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. and yet notwithſtanding, he is not only a Perſon, but alſo the moſt high God himſelf. But this latter we have above refuted: and by this very thing alſo, is ſufficiently refelled, in that he is the vertue of God, to wit, the moſt high, and ſo is manifeſtly diſtinguiſhed from the Supream God. But further, we take the name of Power and Efficacy, in our Argument, properly. But when will they prove, that Chriſt is the Vertue or Power of God properly ſo called? For whether they take the word <hi>Power,</hi> for that Vertue which naturally dwells in God, or for that which flows from him as its fountain, and is alſo in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner communicated to the creatures; neither of them is a perſon, but a quality; and that indeed, an eſſential property of God common to three perſons, as they will have it. But that Chriſt is a perſon, all know, and urge. The ſame may be alſo underſtood by the other term of excellency, which in the ſame place (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24.) is given to Chriſt, to wit, that he is called the Wiſdom of God. For the Wiſdom of God ſpeaking properly, is his attribute, or natural property, by which God both underſtands all things, and diſpoſeth moſt aptly his Counſels and Works. But this is in no ſort a perſon, but in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is his attribute, or natural property, common to three perſons; as is the opinion of the Adverſaries. Certainly, ſince Chriſt is a perſon diſtinct from the Father, and the Father in himſelf, or his own perſon, hath all Wiſdom, whereby he underſtandeth and diſpoſeth all things; neither may any one underſtand, by another perſon, but by himſelf, and Wiſdom implanted in himſelf; Chriſt cannot, ſpeaking properly, be the Wiſdom of God. Therefore neither in like manner, the Power of God. For there is the ſame reaſon of both. It is therefore to be underſtood, as the preaching of the Croſs in the ſame<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18.</note> place to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> is termed, the Vertue or Power of God: in like manner alſo the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. to wit, becauſe in it the ſingular Vertue or Power of God is put forth, and manifeſtly appears to all Believers: ſo alſo Chriſt is called the Vertue or Power, and likewiſe Wiſdom; becauſe in him the ſupream Power and Wiſdom of God hath been put forth, and in him may moſt clearly be perceived by all believers. Let the place it ſelf be looked, and ver. 18.24. be compared together; and that it is ſo, any one will eaſily underſtand. By theſe things then
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64944:111"/> it appeareth, that this inſtance is of no moment to invalid our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeeing we ſpeak of the Efficacy of God properly ſo called, and have ſhewed, that the holy Spirit is the very Power or Efficacy of God, proceeding and flowing from him. Certainly, by the Opinion of the Adverſaries themſelves, it is neceſſary that in one wiſe Chriſt, in an otherwiſe the holy Spirit, be the Power of God. For if Chriſt be the ſubſtantial Power of God, having his proper perſon, and the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit alſo be ſuch a Power of God, there will be two Powers, or ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Vertues in God, having their perſonallity; thoſe two perſons, as ſuch, ſhall be altogether like to themſelves: Of which, neither can be. Not that, becauſe the one or the other efficacy ſhould be in vain; ſince one may altogether ſuffice to do all things. But in him, who himſelf doth nothing in vain, nothing alſo is altogether in vain, or nothing over much. Yea, it is alſo impoſſible, becauſe two forms wholly of the ſame Nature, cannot conſiſt in the ſame ſubject, unleſs perhaps ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to divers parts; which hath no place in God. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the thing would proceed <hi>in infinitum.</hi> Of which we ſhall elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>And this latter therefore cannot conſiſt, becauſe they both hold, and are conſtrained to hold, that thoſe divine perſons, ſo far as they are diſtinct from the Eſſence, are unlike. Wherefore, that thoſe abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of which we have ſpoken, may not happen, it is neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, that the holy Spirit is ſuch a power as is not a perſon. And thus much concerning the former Anſwer to our Argument.</p>
                     <p>The latter Anſwer is placed in a diſtinction, which otherwiſe the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries often uſe, when there is ſpeech of the holy Spirit. For they ſay, the term <hi>holy Spirit</hi> is taken in a double manner: one while for the third perſon of the Deity: another while for his effect or gift flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him, and that indeed properly is called, <hi>holy Spirit;</hi> but this Metonimically, in that the Cauſe is put for the effect. I remember not indeed to have read, that that anſwer is accommodated to this our Argument. But becauſe it may yet be accommodated; it will be worth our labour to examine it here, chiefly becauſe it may ſeem that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be ſaid more ſpeciouſly. For when we by Power or Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of God, underſtand a certain force flowing from God, and his natural power into men, ſome one may ſay, that the holy Spirit is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch a power of God, but taken metonymi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ally. For that Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of God, is the effect or gift of the holy Spirit, properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But in this place is not diſputed of the holy Spirit metonymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, but properly taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not of his gift, but of himſelf. Therefore our Argument is ineffectual, and makes nothing to the matter. But we ſomewhat otherwiſe take the Gift of the holy Spirit in this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, or at leaſt ſtretch it wider than the Adverſaries are commonly wont. For ſo much as I have been able hitherto to find, they are wont by the gift of the holy Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>it, to underſtand thoſe admirable faculties implanted in men by divine Power; as the faculty of propheſying, or ſpeaking with tongues, and other, whether viſible, as they are called, or inviſible, or if you had rather more hidden effects of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:64944:111"/> in men. But that Power of God, of which the places of holy Scripture, brought by us, ſpeak, is not ſuch a faculty, or faculties ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the efficient of them, although it again flow from power naturall reſident in God. Wherefore, if the gift of the holy Spirit ſhould be taken ſo ſtrictly, this Anſwer could not be fitted to our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, or the places by which we have confirmed it; unleſs any one would perhaps ſay, that in all thoſe places in which the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Power of God, are put as equipollent, or the one is put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the other, the name of the holy Spirit, or divine Power, is uſed for ſuch a faculty divinely ingenerated in a man; but no where for the divine Efficacy that effects ſuch faculties in men; which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will the Adverſaries eaſily ſay, nor can it in any manner conſiſt; as partly the places themſelves, a little more diligently looked into, will ſhew to every one; partly will be underſtood by the things which follow. Wherefore that that diſtinction may ſeem to make ſomething againſt our Argument, we will ſuppoſe that our Adverſaries do make that divine Efficacy, alſo flowing from the natural Power of God, which is the cauſe of wonderful effects in men, to be the gift of the holy Spirit, and ſo to be underſtood by the name of the holy Spirit, not properly, but by a Metonymie only; namely, becauſe it flows from the third Perſon of the Deity, which properly may be called the holy Spirit.</p>
                     <p>That therefore we may refell this exception, we ſay that it is in no wiſe to be granted, that that Power and Efficacy of God, which is in this place underſtood, is only metonymically termed the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and not rather properly, as far indeed as propriety hath place here. For if it ſhould be called only metonymically, the Spirit of God or the holy Spirit, to wit becauſe it comes from the holy Spirit properly ſo called; there would be no cauſe why it ſhould not be called likewiſe the Father or Son, ſince it ſhould no leſs come from the Father &amp; Son, then from the holy Spirit even according to the adverſaries opinion, ſince it is ſome effect of the natural power of God: which according to their opinion is common to the three perſons of the Deity; and is indeed firſt in the Father, as the fountain of the Deity; then by him, as they would have it, in the ſon and holy ſpirit, who from him have their Eſſence. Neither may you ſay that that inſpiration is therefore called rather the holy ſpirit, then the Father or ſon; becauſe it immediately proceeds from the holy ſpirit, but from the Father and ſon onely mediately; for what hindreth the Father or the ſon; ſince they have the ſame power in themſelves, efficacious for all things, which the perſon of the holy ſpirit hath, to put it forth alſo by themſelves, as well as the perſon of the holy ſpirit? as we ſee by the holy Scripture they have indeed put it forth. Yea how can it be, in this unity of Eſſence, and all things pertaining to it, that the Father and the ſon ſhould not as immediately put forth their power, as the holy ſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>it? For it is judged that the Father and ſon have ſo commuicated their virtue and power, whence that efficacy or divine inſpiration im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately comes, to the holy Spirit, as that nevertheleſs it remained
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:64944:112"/> the ſame in number in Father and Son, and is put forth by the three perſons by the ſame a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t altogether. Whence therefore is that differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the holy Spirit puts it forth immediately, the Father and the Son mediately? But if the Father and the Son put forth that force and efficacy alike immediately; there is no cauſe, wherefore that force ſhould be termed more the holy Spirit than the Father or the Son, if it be not the holy Spirit himſelf, but be called ſo therefore only becauſe it comes from him. We repeat not that which we have ſaid before, that although the Father and Son ſhould put it forth only mediately, the holy Spirit immediately, yet that could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But further, the adverſaries cannot uſe that anſwer in ſome of the places brought by us, unleſs together they overthrow one of their chief Arguments, whereby they endeavour to prove the holy Spirit to be a <hi>Suppoſitum</hi> and perſon; to wit, that which is drawn from the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons proper to perſons, or at leaſt <hi>Suppoſitums.</hi> For in the firſt place brought by us from <hi>Luke</hi> 1.34. where the holy Spirit is ſaid to come upon <hi>Mary,</hi> the Adverſaries themſelves ſeem to underſtand the perſon of the holy Spirit, eſpecially ſince the action of <hi>coming upon</hi> agrees not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly but to a perſon, or at leaſt to a <hi>Suppoſitum.</hi> I omit that alſo in the place (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.20.) cited by us, the virtue or divine power is ſaid to work in the Apoſtles.

For we have ſeen above that (<hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 31.)

But if the holy Spirit be a perſon, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately put forth that force in the womb of the Virgin, and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Chriſt, the holy Spirit is rather the Father of Chriſt, than God the Father, who performed that only by the intervening of another perſon.

                     <p>TO theſe things I ſee not what they can anſwer, who doubt not to affirm (neither indeed can they otherwiſe, as it ſhall hereafter be made manifeſt) that the very perſon of the holy Spirit is given to men, together with his effects. Therefore others endeavour to decline the blow, that they affirm, that not the holy Spirit properly ſo called, is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to men by God: but its effect, or rather various effects, ſuch as are thoſe which, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are largly enough rehearſed, and others, common to all believers. For theſe are by a Metonymie ſignified by the name of the holy ſpirit, when he is ſaid to be given unto men, and ſo to be received and had of them. For the efficient cauſe is put for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Although ſome who ſay, there is a Metalepſis in the phraſe, ſeem to take the thing a little otherwiſe. For neither do they ſeem to take the name of the holy Spirit it ſelf for his effects or gifts, but for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry divine perſon which they hold. Nevertheleſs, in the mean while, they ſignifie that the giving, paſſively taken, is attributed to him only improperly; becauſe that which may properly agree to the effects, may be alſo improperly attributed to the efficient cauſe it ſelf; ſeeing the effects of the holy Spirit may be properly given, not he himſelf. And indeed both theſe ſeem to themſelves to deal more warily, than thoſe who ſimply confeſs that the holy Spirit himſelf is given, yet in the mean time they do not perceive, that both this hole by which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to get out is ſtopt; and likewiſe, although I ſhould ſomewhat enlarge it to them, yet are they no whit leſs held faſt bound. For firſt, it is falſe, that the effects only of the holy Spirit, not the holy Spirit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is given to men. And further, that when he is ſaid to be given, or received by us, or had, it is ſaid but by a Metonymie or Metalepſis.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:64944:113"/> Beſides, although it was granted, it muſt be no whit the leſs confeſſed, that the holy Spirit is not the moſt high God.</p>
                     <p>As to the former; we ſhall demonſtrate it, firſt by certain general rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and common to all thoſe places of which we treat; then by other more ſpecial and proper to certain places; and laſtly from certain hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes of the Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>As to the general reaſon; If by the name of the holy Spirit in theſe places, of which we treat, is underſtood ſome divine and holy inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſome power flowing from God, which is as it were breathed into men; the holy Spirit is properly given, that is, not by a Metonymie only, or by a Metalepſis is ſaid to be given unto men, to be received and had of them. That the thing is ſo, will be afterward underſtood. For we ſhall firſt ſhew that ſuch an inſpiration is underſtood by the name of the holy ſpirit, when he is ſaid to be given to us, to be received and had by us: although it may eaſily ſeem truth to any one by it ſelf. Chriſt himſelf ſhewed it and repreſented it by a certain external breathing, when after his reſurrection<note n="*" place="margin">

                        </gap>ce above noted by us, and the like to them, is taken in that ſenſe in which at that time it was taken commonly among the <hi>Jewes.</hi> For do we think that <hi>John</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſt, when ſpeaking to the people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But this is that ſpirit, which Chriſt promiſed to them that ask, and which was afterwards given to the Apoſtles and other diſciples, as is underſtood as well by the thing it ſelf, as alſo by the place, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4, 5. is manifeſt. What elſe meant <hi>Peter</hi> when he diſcourſed to the people of the holy ſpirit newly poured out, and promiſed the ſame to the auditors,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Verſ.</hi> 38.</note> if they would repent and be baptized into the name of Jeſus Chriſt; do we think, that he uſed the word holy Spirit, in a ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unknown to them, that is, that he would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, or at leaſt was not underſtood of them? In like manner when after Chap. 5. in the Senate of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>We are his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of theſe things, and ſo is alſo the holy ſpirit, which God hath given to them that obey him;</hi> do we think that he uſed the word holy ſpirit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than thoſe Elders of the <hi>Jewes</hi> were wont to take it? Or did not he therefore mention theſe things that the adverſaries well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what the term holy ſpirit ſignyfied, and how much was to be given to its teſtimony, might give credit to his ſayings, and the reſt of the Apoſtles? The ſame is to be held of the words of the ſame <hi>Peter</hi> uſed in the houſe of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> in which he affirmed, that Chriſt was anointed
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64944:114"/> with the holy Spirit, that by this means he might conciliate to him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority. What? that both <hi>John,</hi> and Chriſt in him, have declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the words, by which the holy Spirit was more obſcurely deſigned by the ſimple word either of Spirit or holy Spirit: as appears by the places brought by us, <hi>John</hi> 7.39. and Chap. 14.16, 17. to which add verſ. 26. of the ſame chap. and 15.26. Now this doth ſufficiently ſhew, that the ſignification of that word was then commonly known. But what did the <hi>Jews</hi> of that time commonly underſtand by the name of the holy Spirit? did they perhaps mean a Divine perſon? Why then comes it to paſs, that not ſo much indeed as any footſteps of that opinion remained among the <hi>Jews</hi> after that time, nor doth it appear in thoſe who were next unto thoſe times? Did they, that they might diſquiet the Chriſtians, forſwear all their opinions comonly received by all? You can never perſwade this to an intilligent man.

Which ſignification, as we have ſaid, was not unknown even to the Gentiles themſelves, although in the mean time they did moſt grievouſly erre in the thing, taking a falſe inſpiration for a true one, a diveliſh for a divine. But this pertaines not by it ſelf to the force and ſignificaton of the word. But now if the name of the holy Spirit be taken in thoſe places of which we treat, for that divine inſpiration or ſome power which from God flowes into men; why is the holy Spirit ſaid to be given to us, or further to be received or had by us, one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y by a Metonymy or Metalepſis? Why is not the holy Spirit properly ſo called (as far indeed as that word in this matter may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken properly) acknowledged to be given to us? For if it be not given properly, either it is therefore, becauſe this holy inſpiration may not be ſaid to be the holy Spirit, but only improperly, to wit, by a Meton<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But both is falſe. For as to the former, thoſe things which are called by ſome name only by a Metonimy of the efficent cauſe, do not by themſelves deſerve that name, but therefore only are ſo called, becauſe they come from the efficient cauſe, to which this name doth by it ſelf and in the firſt place agree. But that power which is inſpired into men by God doth of it ſelf deſerve to be termed the holy Spirit, and accordingly is ſo called, without any regard had, that it comes from ſuch a cauſe, which properly may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>phorically, or by reaſon of ſimilitude, it is termed <hi>Spirit:</hi> For in this place the propriety of the word is not ſo looked upon as oppoſed to a Metaphor, but as to a Metonimy. Since this now is the queſtion. But if thou wilt therefore ſay this inſpiration is improperly termed the holy Spirit, becauſe it is called Spirit metaphorically; ſee by what meanes thou wilt defend that that third perſon of the deity is properly called the holy Spirit. For therefore alſo they think that perſon to be termed Spirit, becauſe he is breathed by the other two: but not therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a ſpiritual ſubſtance; otherwiſe that appellation would no more agree to that perſon, then to the other two. What then? Is that perſon properly breathed or blown out? Certainly far leſs doth it agree to him to be breathed then, to this divine inſpiration, of which we treat: ſince that comes not forth without God; this proceeds from God, and is inſpired into men. It is manifeſt therefore that that divine inſpiration is properly termed the holy ſpirit not metonimycally only. As to the latter I ſcarſe believe the adverſaries will deny that that very inſpiration is properly given. For how is that which is breathed and put into the hearts of men to their greateſt profit, not properly given them? Therefore there is no Metalepſis here to be ſought, by which it may come to paſs, that that which properly agrees only to the effect, may improperly be attributed to the efficient cauſe, ſince here the very efficient cauſe of thoſe effects, which are underſtood, that is the very divine inſpiration, is by it ſelf given to men. And let theſe things ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice concerning the general reaſon, and common to all the places which we treat of.</p>
                     <p>As for the ſpecial Reaſons, more proper to certain places, thoſe words of Chriſt, which we have before cited out of <hi>John</hi> 14.16, 17. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be firſt mentioned, <hi>I will ask the Father, and he ſhall give you another Advocate, that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth,; whom the world cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him. But ye know him; for he dwelleth with you</hi> (to wit, as inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting in Chriſt, he did as it were converſe among the Diſciples) <hi>and ſhall be in you;</hi> that is, and further, ſhall be not only with you, or among you, as now, but alſo in your ſelves, being given of the Father unto you. What could be ſaid more clearly, to ſhew that the holy Spirit, properly ſo called, is given of God, that it is a gift which may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the Father by faithful prayers? For what? Is not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter that holy Spirit properly ſo called; or is it not but by a Metalep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, ſaid to be given to the Diſciples by the Father? The former the Adverſaries cannot ſay, unleſs they will deny that the third perſon of the Deity, is the holy Spirit, properly ſo called; which yet they chiefly will have. For that the ſame is underſtood by the Comforter, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together contend, and urge both the name it ſelf of Paraclet, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, as alſo the word <hi>another</hi> added to it, and the actions proper to perſons attributed to him in this ſpeech of Chriſt; of which below we will ſomewhat treat. This may of right be ſaid, that if it be not there ſpoken of the holy Spirit, properly ſo called, it is no where
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64944:115"/> ſpoken of him. It remains therefore, that they ſay that it is indeed here ſpoken of the third perſon of the Deity, and that this perſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        </gap>r: but that he is not ſaid to be given to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles by the Father, but by a Metalepſis: namely, becauſe its effects or various gifts are to be given to them. But neither hath that ſhift here any place. For by comparing of that place with the words in verſe 26. of the ſame chapter, and alſo with the words verſe 26. of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing chapter, it will eaſily appear to any one, that Chriſt ſo far aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, that the Father being asked of him, was about to give the holy Spirit to the Diſciples, as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ould ſend him in the name of Chriſt, or Chriſt himſelf ſhould ſend him unto the Diſciples from the Father. For ſo he ſaith in that former place, <hi>But the Comforter, the holy Spirit, whom the Father will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things,</hi> &amp;c. But in the latter, <hi>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will ſend to you from the Father, the Spirit of Truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he ſhall teſtifie of me.</hi> And truly what other thing could either the Father of the Son do, pertaining to that giving, than that he ſhould ſend the holy Spirit to the Diſciples with that intent, that he might remain in them for ever, and produce thoſe divine effects, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards appeared in them? But that ſending, and the coming of the holy Spirit, which follows it, doth not agree firſt to the effects of the holy Spirit, and only conſequently to him; which ſhould be, if it were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to him only by a Metalepſis; but on the contrary. Whence the Adverſaries are wont to prove, the perſon of the holy Spirit by that miſſion; which they could not do, if they did judge it primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and of it ſelf to agree to the gifts of the holy Spirit. For as much as ſuch a miſſion, if it be in no ſort proper to a perſon, cannot alſo prove it. But if then that miſſion primarily and of it ſelf agree to the holy Spirit, not to his effects, there will be the ſame reaſon of the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alſo, which we have ſeen to conſiſt in that ſending. But hence ariſeth alſo another reaſon of the ſame thing. For that the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhould teach the Diſciples all things, and recal all Chriſts ſayings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their remembrance, is put chap, 14.26. as the conſequent of the ſending of the holy Spirit; and moreover alſo of the giving it. But if ſo far only the holy Spirit ſhould be given, as its gifts are beſtowed, that thing ſhould be contained in the giving it ſelf of the holy Spirit, but not be a conſequent of it. For that imparting of the knowledge of divine things, even firſt of all pertains to the producing of gifts coming from the holy Spirit upon the Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>This place might have enough warned the Adverſaries, that they ſhould not date to deny the holy Spirit properly ſo called, to be given to us together with his effects. But there want not alſo other places which do the ſame. For by other Adverſaries, who therefore uſe not ſuch an anſwer, hath that place of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 5.5. been taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, where he ſaith, <hi>The Love of God</hi> (that is, the ſence of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love) <hi>is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the holy Spirit which is given to us.</hi> Where indeed it is ſaid concerning that Spirit which diffuſeth the ſence of divine Love in our hearts, and ſo is the Author of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64944:115"/> gift, that he is given to us. To which place may be added that of the ſame Epiſtle, chap. 18.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit of adoption, whereby</hi> (that is, by whoſe force and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe) <hi>we cry, Abba (Father) for the Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs to our ſpirit, that we are the Children of God.</hi> Of which alſo in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> chap. 4.6. he ſaith, <hi>God hath ſent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba (Father.)</hi> So alſo 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. it is ſaid, <hi>For God hath not given to us the ſpirit of fear, but of Power, of Love, and of a ſound mind.</hi> For what elſe is it, than that God hath not given to us ſuch a Spirit, as ſhould effect fear, and cowardiſe in us, but ſuch as begets in us, ſtrength and fortitude, charity and prudence, or ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety? But I remember not that I have hitherto heard or read of any, who could dare to deny that the divine Spirit, the efficient cauſe of theſe gifts, is the holy Spirit, properly ſo called. Neither indeed in theſe places, hath the Metalepſis deviſed by others any place. For the effects alſo of the holy Spirit, are rehearſed in the ſame places, as ſome things diverſe from the holy Spirit given, and ſo, as effects of the thing given. But if by that Metalepſis, the holy Spirit were ſaid to be given, to wit, in reſpect of the effects, thoſe effects ſhould be contained in the thing given, nor ſhould be mentioned, or diſtinct from it. And let theſe things be ſaid out of the ſacred Writings againſt the Metonimy and Metalepſis, deviſed in theſe manners of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>As to the Hypotheſis of the Adverſaries, although we have uſed them in ſome part already, yet it is further to be added, that by ſuch an Anſwer to our Argument, their own reaſon is vehemently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, which they are wont to bring further to prove the immenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the holy Spirit, and conſequently its ſupream Deity; to wit, that the holy Spirit dwelt in all Believers diſperſed through the whole world. For two wayes they weaken this Argument. Firſt, becauſe if the very holy Spirit, properly ſo called, be not given to Believers, but only its effects, it cannot be proved that the holy Spirit himſelf, or his Eſſence, is in very deed in every Believer, which is neceſſary to the concluding of their reaſon. Again, Becauſe neither ſuch immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, as they underſtand, can be thence proved, unleſs withal they make alſo the effect of the holy Spirit, or at leaſt all its effects diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the hearts of Believers, though the whole world joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be immenſe, and the ſupream God. Therefore the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries cannot deny, that the holy Spirit it ſelf; to wit, properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, is given by God to believers, but that together they take away both the teſtimonies of the holy Scripture, and their own aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>But now let us ſomewhat looſen thoſe bonds by which we have ſhewn them to be held, and let us grant to them, ſeeing they will have it ſo, that not the holy Spirit, properly ſo called, is given to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, but its effect only, yet they ſhall not eſcape. For neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, we will hence ſhew that the holy Spirit is not the moſt high God.</p>
                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:64944:116"/>
                     <p>For firſt, if the holy Spirit were the moſt high God, it could not be ſaid, no not by a Metonymy or Metalepſis, of him, that he is given or beſtowed by another upon men, or that men receive him. For who would not reject ſuch a manner of ſpeaking, as abſurd and unworthy of the moſt high God? More ſoberly do the holy Scripture ſpeak of the moſt high God, than to feign in his names ſuch trops. But if yet any man contend, that ſuch ſpeaking is not unbeſeeming God, or abſurd, let him ſhew an example of the like manner of ſpeaking, in the name either of the moſt high God, or the Father, or any other which is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent. Beſides, if it were ſo, it ſhould not be underſtood that that certain gift, or if you had rather, kind of gifts is given, which yet all underſtand to be given, when the holy Spirit is ſaid to be given. For the gifts and effects of the moſt high God, are of moſt large extent; for what good ſoever there is, it comes from him. Therefore if thou ſhouldſt hear that the moſt high God is given, namely, becauſe his gifts are given, either thou wouldſt underſtand that all gifts are given toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or, if thou wouldſt underſtand only a certain kind of gifts to be given, thou wouldſt believe that to be given, which is of all the moſt excellent, either alone, or conjoyned with others. The ſame thing therefore ſhould be thought of the holy Spirit, if he were the moſt high God, and not ſaid to be given but in reſpect of gifts and effects only. But neither all gifts are underſtood to be given, when we hear the holy Spirit is given; nor that which is of all the greateſt, to wit, immortal life, or perfect juſtification; but preſently our mind is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a divine breathing or inſpiration, or the effects of it in men; to wit, becauſe the divine Spirit, properly ſo called, is a divine inſpiration, or a force flowing from God into men, breathed from heaven into their hearts. This, I ſay, is the true ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſe, why our mind hearing the holy Spirit to be given, is carried to that certain kind of gift or gifts. But the adverſaries will except that there is in this caſe another reaſon of the name of God, or the Father, or alſo of the Son, another of the name of the holy Spirit, although he be the Supream God. For they ſo diſpute, as we have before ſhewed; although all the works to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out are common to the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now then they will ſay, that that kind of gift or gifts, which we underſtand, as ſoon as we hear the holy Spirit is given, doth pertain to ſanctification. Therefore it is not deſigned by the name of God common to three perſons, not by the name of the Father, nor Son, but the holy Spirit. Thou ſeeſt by what circuits the mind is led by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries thither, whither it is forthwith ſtraight carried. But is it credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that thoſe, whether <hi>Jews</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Were thoſe auditors of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt or <hi>Peter,</hi> whom we mentioned before, ſo knowing of thoſe things, that they could think at firſt, when they heard of the holy Spirit
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:64944:116"/> to be poured out upon them, that ſome effect ſhould be given them, not peculiar to the firſt and ſecond perſon of the Deity, but the third to whom it is proper to ſanctify; therefore that effect did pertain to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and withal was a divine inſpiration? Was it not more ready for them to think that which the word it ſelf declared, that a divine inſpiration or its effects were promiſed to them? But beſides, whence is it manifeſt to the adverſaries, that the th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ee perſons of the Deity have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves thus parted thoſe three gifts? Were they perhaps pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at their councel, that they ſo boldly affirme theſe things? They will ſay, from the holy Scriptures it is manifeſt to them concerning that thing, as which doth chefliy aſcribe creation to the Father, redemption to the Son, ſanctification to the holy Spirit. Of creation and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is not now place of diſputing. Yet it may be ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y the way, that creation, or that firſt production of all things, is aſcribed to the Father, not cheifly only but alſo ſolely, ſince he was the ſole author of it. That redemption is aſcribed to the Son, neither alone ſimply, nor as the firſt author; but as the cheif middle cauſe, who in the name of the Father and by his command, performed the whole work of our redemption and ſalvation, and as yet performes it. As to ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; neither is that more often aſcribed unto the holy Spirit, than to the Father or Son, eſpecially openly; neither is it attributed as to ſome perſon, but as to a thing by which ſanctification is performed. Which firſt, is manifeſt from thence, that where as it is read expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Father that he ſanctifies, as alſo of Chriſt; it is no where ſaid of the holy Spirit, that I know, that it ſanctifies, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> onely that in or by it men are ſanctified, or ſome ſuch way which is not proper to a perſon, is ſanctification aſcribed unto it. Of the Father you have plain places, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.36.17.17. to which add 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23. Where it eaſily appeares, that there it is ſpoken of the Father, ſince the holy Scripture underſtand him alone by the name of <hi>God</hi> ſubjectively put, cheifly when he is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from Chriſt. Neither ſhall I eaſily beleeve that the Adverſaries will take this place of the holy Spirit onely. Alſo in the Old teſtament many places occur, in which God affirmes, that he it is who ſanctifyes the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which either ſpeak of the Father alone, as we think, or at leaſt of the Father alſo, not of the holy Spirit alone. Of Chriſt you have teſtimonies, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11.13.12. For I paſs by thoſe places, in which in ſome other manner ſanctification is aſcribed either to the Father or the Son. But if the holy Spirit were a divine perſon equal to the Father in all things, and to him in ſome cheif reſpect the action of ſanctifying did agree, how could it be, that of him it ſhould not be once ſaid, that he ſanctifies, but of the Father and Son it ſhould be ſaid plainly? The action of ſanctifying might be directly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed indeed to the holy Spirit, although it were not a perſon: ſince we ſee, that to many other<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.17, 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13.</note> things, and chiefly to qualities which they call active, actions are directly attributed in holy Scripture, and alſo the very act of ſanctifying. But it cannot be that the holy Spirit ſhould be a perſon, and that the act of ſanctifying ſhould agree to it in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner, above the Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:64944:117"/> where attributed to it. We have by the way touched above alſo other reaſons; for we ſhewed in the Argument next foregoing, that it would follow out of that ſuppoſition of the adverſaries, that the holy Spirit is the Father of Chriſt, rather than God, who is every where ſaid to be his Father.</p>
                     <p>We have ſeen alſo<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. <hi>3.</hi> of this Section.</note> above in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> that Sanctification is aſcribed to the Father, Preſervation of us to Chriſt, the holy Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not indeed ſo much as mentioned: For ſo the Greek Text hath it; <hi>Jude, a ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, and the brother of James, to them that are ſanctified in God the Father and preſerved in Chriſt Jeſus, the called.</hi> Or, as ſome later Interpreters, in ſome manner ſtudying the perſpicuity of the ſentence, have rendred it, <hi>called of God the Father</hi> (or by the Father) <hi>ſanctified and ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Is it credible, if the holy Spirit were a divine perſon, to whom the action of ſanctifying in ſome reſpect ſhould rather agree, than to the Father and Son, that this action ſhould be attributed, as proper, to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the mention of the holy Spirit, being altogether omitted? We have ſeen it alſo affirmed by <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6.</note> That all things, in any manner pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Salvation, are from God the Father, as the firſt cauſe; all things in like manner by the Son, as the middle cauſe, no mention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made of the holy Spirit. But if t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e holy Spirit were a divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to whom ſo notable an action, ſo greatly pertaining to our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould agree, in ſome remarkable reſpect, above thoſe two perſons: not onely the mention of it could not be omitted, but alſo it could not be rightly affirmed, that <hi>all things are of the Father, or that all things are by Chriſt.</hi> For that perſon of the holy Spirit, either as the firſt and ſupream cauſe, ſhould have ſomething in ſo great a matter above the Father; or as a midle cauſe above the Son; when notwithſtanding not ſome, but <hi>all things</hi> are entirely attributed to the Father as the firſt cauſe, and to the Son as the midle cauſe, yet holding the next place from the firſt. Laſtly the common opinion concerning the Trinity doth not bear ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of actions and offices. For if thoſe perſons have one and the ſame numerical underſtanding, will, power, &amp; there is not any of theſe more in one than in the reſt; it is neceſſary, that there be alſo one operation in number of all theſe, as even the adverſaries confeſs; and that one perſon act not any thing, more than another. For ſuch diverſity or inequality of action could not ariſe any otherwiſe thence, than that one perſon of this thing, another of that, a third of another thing, ſhould either think rather, or would rather exerciſe it, or laſtly could better perfome it. But ſuch a difference cannot be held in that unity: becauſe ſeeing thoſe perſons think altogether with the ſame underſtanding, not with another and another; in like manner alſo they both will with the ſame will, and work outwardly by the ſame power in number: one thinks, wills, and workes as much as another; not one more than another. It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt therefore that ſanctification, and whatſoever pertaines to it, doth in no wiſe more agree to the holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> than to the Father and Son, if he were one God <hi>with both.</hi> And hence ariſeth a third reaſon, by which it is demonſtrated that it cannot indeed be ſaid, no not by a Metonymie
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:64944:117" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the holy Spirit, that he is given or received by men, if he be held to be that one God together with the Father and Son. For it will follow that the holy Spirit is no more given to us, and received of us, than the Father and the Son. For thoſe gifts and effects, in reſpect of which, the holy Spirit ſhould be ſaid to be given, ſhould no more come from the holy Spirit, than from the Father and the Son; nor in one reſpect from theſe, and in another from that, but in the ſame altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But who hath ever heard, who hath read, that the Father was given to any, or, was prayed to be given to us, when the gifts of the holy Spirit were prayed for? Who asks at this day, that the Son might be given to him, being about to ask for thoſe ſame gifts? Who would brook him, that ſhould ask Chriſt that he would give the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him, or would pray to the perſon of the holy Spirit, that he would beſtow the Father and Son, and himſelf alſo upon us? But if you look on the ſome of the Adverſaries opinion, it will be very law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to pray after that manner. And certainly believers, when they ask ſpiritual gifts, do not intend, that thoſe things be given, which may by name come from the third perſon of the Deity; as if it were not all one to them, whether the ſame come immediately either from the Father or the Son. For what other thing do they then ſeek, than that being endued with divine virtue, they may be filled either with more plentiful knowledge of divine myſteries, or ſome coeleſtial joy, or ſingular fervour of piety, or other heavenly gifts? All which that they may immediately come, as well from the Father and Son, as from the ſuppoſed perſon of the holy Spirit, is eaſily underſtood by all. Wherefore, if the holy Spirit be the moſt high God, there is no cauſe, why thoſe gifts ſhould be rather called the holy Spirit, than the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Son: Or, when the ſame are asked or given of God, the holy Spirit ſhould rather be ſaid to be asked or given, than the Father and Son.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, If the holy Spirit were the moſt high God, he ſhould not be given by another perſon, nor commanded to be asked; but from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf rather, as both the chief and proper fountain, thoſe gifts ſhould at leaſt ſomewhere, be commanded to be asked: But that is no where done. In ſome ſort a double reaſon doth lye hid in this one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>One, That the gifts flowing from him, are no where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be asked of him, as neither any thing elſe; of which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſomething hath been ſaid above,<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. <hi>2.</hi> of this Section.</note> ſo that there is no need I ſhould here ſtay on it.</p>
                     <p>Another, That the holy Spirit is commanded to be asked, and ſaid to be given of another, to wit, the Father.</p>
                     <p>For, from hence it follows, that the holy Spirit cannot choſe but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute his gifts, when the Father ſo wills; and on the contrary, not diſtribute them when the Father will not. For if he could diſtribute them when the Father is unwilling, or not diſtribute them though the Father be willing; it were better to ask the holy Spirit himſelf, that he would beſtow them on us, than the Father. Beſides, that it would
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:64944:118" rendition="simple:additions"/> thence follow, that the Father is not the moſt high God; as who hath not all gifts abſolutely in his own power, and although he would give ſome gifts to men, yet he cannot but by anothers conſent. But now if the holy Spirit cannot but diſtribute his gifts, when the Father will, and not diſtribute them when the Father will not, and ſo neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf to anothers will, he is not the moſt high God. For the moſt high God is altogether at his own will, at his own diſpoſe, nor doth he ever faſhion himſelf after anothers will, eſpecially neceſſarily. For he ſhould be in anothers power, and ſo acknowledge another ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, by which very thing, he would ceaſe to be the moſt high God. Now, if you ſay, that the holy Spirit indeed cannot do otherwiſe than the Father will, but that cometh to paſs, not becauſe he is in the Fathers power, but becauſe he is of the ſame numerical Eſſence and Will with him, ſo that he cannot otherwiſe either will or doe, than the Father willeth or doth. See into what difficulties and ſnares you caſt your ſelf. For if the Father and holy Spirit, by reaſon of that unity, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily will and do the ſame thing, as indeed it cannot otherwiſe be, if they were of the ſame Eſſence; when the Father willed to ſend, and ſo hath ſent the holy Spirit, the holy Spirit alſo willed to ſend, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently hath indeed ſent himſelf; and on the contrary, when the holy Spirit would be ſent, the Father himſelf alſo would be ſent; when the holy Spirit would, in a corporeal ſhape, deſcend upon Chriſt, and did accordingly deſcend, the Father alſo would deſcend in the ſame, and did accordingly deſcend. And what end at length will there be of abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? But it is neceſſary that they caſt themſelves into Quagmires, yea, into Precipices, who of their own accord turn from a plain and ſimple Truth, ſo clearly expreſſed in holy Scriptures, which they do, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that the holy Spirit himſelf is not given us, but his effect only. We following that ſtrait path, having ſhewen, that it follows from this, namely, that the holy Spirit is given to men, that he is not the ſupream God; now we ſhall alſo ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now this hence is eaſily manifeſt, that no perſon at the ſame time can be ſo given to many, much leſs to innume<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And, we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſeen, that the holy Spirit is thus given to believers, diſperſed through the whole world. But that a perſon cannot be given in the ſaid man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is hence manifeſt, that that perſon is either infinite or finite; if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If finite; that I urge not, that it cannot by the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries be acknowleged for the moſt high God, it cannot be ſo given at once to many, and conſequently to innumerable men, that in very deed it ſhould exiſt in every one; otherwiſe it would be torn into parts, which very thing it ſelf would deſtroy that perſon.</p>
                     <p>It is eaſie now to obſerve, that that inſtance of the Adverſaries, fetcht from the giving of Chriſt, hath no force: For they ſay that Chriſt alſo was given to us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. Some add alſo that of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi>
                        <pb n="217" facs="tcp:64944:118"/> 8.32. That God <hi>will with Chriſt give us all things.</hi> But they ſay that Chriſt is both a perſon, and beſides the moſt high God. That he is not the moſt high God we have ſhewn before, and it may be evinced even out of thoſe very places which are alleaged: For the moſt high God is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a little one, nor is born, nor is the Son of God; he cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered for us, no not indeed by himſelf, much leſs by another; he is not ſuch as that he could be ſpared or not ſpared.</p>
                     <p>But beſides, that we may mind what is proper to this place; when it is ſaid by <hi>Iſaias,</hi> that a ſon is given to us, it is not ſignified, that he is ſo given to us, that he may be indeed in us or poſeſſed by us in any manner, in which ſence the holy Spirit is ſaid to be given to us, but that he is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for our profit, or for our cheifeſt good and benefit; which eaſily appears from the preceeding verſe, where in the ſame ſenſe he is ſaid to be a little one <hi>born to us.</hi> For neither is Chriſt ſaid to be <hi>born to us,</hi> that he ſhould exiſt in us, or be poſſeſſed by us, but that by him we ſhould be profited. For the Dative caſe of the perſon often ſignifies, <hi>finem cui,</hi> the end <hi>to which,</hi> as they ſpeak, not the poſſeſſor, as is obſerved by learned men. And hence the appellation of the end <hi>to which</hi> ariſeth. But if any ſay, although from that place of <hi>Iſa.</hi> it cannot be evinced, that Chriſt is ſo given to us, as to dwell in us,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17.</note> yet that it is manifeſt from elſewhere; For the Apoſtle wiſheth to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that Chriſt may dwel by faith in their hearts: it is firſt to be obſerved, that Chriſt dwells in the hearts of beleevers, not by vertue of that giving, of which there is mention in <hi>Iſa.</hi> as the next cauſe; as the holy Spirit dwels in them as ſoon as he is given to beleevers, ſince that giving of Chriſt hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to men even as yet unbeleevers, and hath been accompliſhed as ſoon as he was born: but Chriſt dwells not in the hearts of men but by faith, as the place it ſelf ſhewes. Beſides, this is to be obſerved, that Chriſt is there taken Metonymically for the religion or doctrine by him deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it is alſo beneath in the ſame epiſtle chap. 4.20, 21. So alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> is taken for the Law delivered by him, <hi>Acts.</hi> 15.21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. The ſenſe then of the words of the Apoſtle is. That God may give you, that you may believe in your hearts, and adhere conſtantly to the doctrine of Chriſt, and that it may be thorowly fixed in your mindes by faith. And though at length it were ſpoken of the perſon of Chriſt; yet it would not follow that <hi>Paul</hi> willeth, that he in very deed and properly ſhould dwell in the hearts of beleevers, but that he ſhould do it by his grace, aide and ſpirit, which both the Apoſtles wiſh, and the manner or middle cauſe of that inhabitation expreſſed by him, to wit, by faith, doth ſufficiently ſhew; For if Chriſt by his Eſſence ſhould dwell in them, he ſhould dwell in all men, whether beleevers or not beleevers. For that would be by reaſon of his natural immenſity, which would be excluded from no place whatſoever it be; neither in that thing could there be regard had either of faith or infidelity. For it is neceſſary, that what is immenſe in Eſſence, fill all places and all mens hearts. Neither then that place of <hi>Iſa.</hi> not this to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> makes any thing to purpoſe. But that place of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> (chap. 8. 32.) ſaith not the ſame with that of <hi>Iſa.</hi> For <hi>that all things ſhall be given to us with Chriſt,</hi>
                        <pb n="218" facs="tcp:64944:119"/> we may ſo interpret, and indeed more rightly, that God wil give to us all things (to wit, which he hath promiſed us) even as to Chriſt, or as before in the ſame chap. the Apoſtle had ſaid, that we ſhall be co-heirs of Chriſt, and be glorified together with him, verſ. 17. For we muſt be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the image of the Son of God, that he may be the firſt-born among many brethren verſ. 29. which verſe the Apoſtle ſeemes here to eye. But the manner of ſpeaking, ſhould offend none, as if, <hi>with him,</hi> could not ſignifie, <hi>in like manner as to him,</hi> ſince we have ſeen alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, we are to be together glorified, to wit, with Chriſt; that is, ſo as Chriſt was glorified. So in the ſame Epiſtle,<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6, 8.</note> it is ſaid, that <hi>we are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed with him,</hi> (that is, as well as he) and <hi>that our old man is crucified with him: that we are dead with him: that we ſhall live with him;</hi> that is, no otherwiſe than as he.

                        <head>An Appendix of the precedent Argument, in which the places are urged, in which the holy Spirit is called, <hi>The Earneſt,</hi> and by it men are ſaid to be ſealed, and to be powered upon, baptized and drencht.</head>
                        <p>TO the teſtimonies which ſpeak of the giving and receiving of the holy Spirit, let us joyn others, which although of themſelves alſo they might be urged againſt the vulgar opinion concerning the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, yet becauſe they are not much unlike to the former, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will have them to be as an overplus of the former Argument. And firſt, hither pertaine thoſe teſtimonies of Scripture, in which the holy Spirit is called a <hi>Pledge;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.14.</note> or rather, as the Greek Text hath it, <hi>The Earneſt,</hi> either ſimply, or of our inheritance. But the earneſt is part of the thing promiſed, given before hand, which makes him to whom any thing is promiſed, certain of the reſidue alſo. Therefore ſeeing God doth not as yet in very deed exhibit the inheritance promiſed, he gives to us, as it were aforehand, the holy Spirit, which may make us ſure of the future inheritance, until he really bring us into the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it. But hence it ſufficiently appears, that the holy Spirit is not the moſt high God. For he is the promiſer, not the earneſt or pledge of the thing promiſed. Who doth pledge or give himſelf for an earneſt? Or how can God be received of a man for an earneſt or pledge? For an earneſt is in ſome manner, poſſeſſed by him to whom it is given. But how may the moſt high God be poſſeſſed by a man? Beſides, is it credible, that God hath now already given us more, than he promiſed he will give in time to come? That ſurely neither doth the nature of an earneſt bear, nor this ſuffer, to wit, that by the confeſſion of all, we ſhall here after at length become far more happy, and excellent in dignity, yea, then truly happy and glorious. But he had given us more now than is the inheritance it ſelf, promiſed unto us, if the holy Spirit were the moſt high God. For who dares to compare our inheritance, though infinite in time, with God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
                        <pb n="219" facs="tcp:64944:119"/>
                        <p>But the places quoted, advertiſe us alſo of another manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſed of the holy Spirit, which ſhews that he is not a divine perſon. And that is, that Believers are ſaid to be ſealed with the holy Spirit. For ſo it is plainly written, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. to which the place chap. 4.30. is like. For though it is ſaid in the latter place, that the <hi>Epheſians</hi> were ſealed <hi>in the holy Spirit,</hi> which ſome interpret, <hi>by the holy Spirit;</hi> yet we ſhall ſhew a little after, that alſo in other places, and thoſe ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed where it is ſpoken of the holy Spirit, the particle <hi>in</hi> by an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiſm is redundant: and that it is ſo in this place is apparent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, both by comparing of the words chap. 1.13. where that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle is omitted, and by the thing it ſelf. For neither here would the Apoſtle ſhew, who hath ſealed, but with how excellent a ſign we have been marked, and as it were ſecured by God, conſidering which, we might not doubt of our future redemption, and further conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how much is given to us, we might diligently take heed, that we do not, peradventure by vanity of words, deprive our ſelves of ſo great a good, and raſe and blot out the character and mark ſtamped on us by God. But the Apoſtle had not expreſſed that, if he had only ſaid, that we are ſealed by the holy Spirit; unleſs perhaps any one ſhould take ſuch words in ſuch a ſence, in which we would have them ſaid: to wit, that it may be underſtood, that we have been ſealed with the divine Spirit, or that the holy Spirit is as it were a ſign, mark, and character impreſſed on us, by which God hath marked us as his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per goods, and hath made us ſacred and inviolable, and ſafe from all danger of periſhing, if we do our duty. The ſame thing the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hath ſhewed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22 eſpecially if one compare the place with thoſe two, which we have cited out of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and chiefly with the former. For in both places, the ſame thing is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, nor do the words much differ. For there indeed, after the Apoſtle had ſaid, ver. 21. <hi>Now he which ſtabliſheth us with you in Chriſt,</hi> (Greek, <hi>into Chriſt) and hath anointed us, is God.</hi> He adds, ver. 22. <hi>who hath alſo ſealed us, and given the earneſt of the Spirit in our hearts.</hi> But here he ſaith, <hi>In whom</hi> (that is, <hi>by whom,</hi> to wit, <hi>Chriſt) alſo after that ye believed, ye were ſealed with that holy Spirit of promiſe</hi> (that is, the holy Spirit promiſed) <hi>which is the Pledge</hi> (or <hi>Earneſt) of our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto the day of redemption, &amp;c.</hi> namely, the latter clauſe is added for explication of the former, and what is the earneſt of our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the ſame is alſo the ſeal with which we are marked. Hence then it again appears, that the holy Spirit is neither the moſt high God, nor a perſon. For neither is any thing ſealed with a perſon, but with ſome thing: nor is any thing more abſurd, than to ſay that the moſt high God, whoſe propriety we are, and who hath ſealed us unto the day of redemption, is the ſeal it ſelf wherewith we are ſealed.</p>
                        <p>By theſe things alſo, it appears, that the Adverſaries labour in vain; who endeavour out of the words <hi>Epheſ</hi> 4.30. to deduct the perſon of the holy Spirit, becauſe he is ſaid to be grieved and vexed by us, as if the like things were not attributed to Charity, which is ſaid, <hi>to rejoyce in the Truth:</hi> and on the contrary, not to rejoyce (which is
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:64944:120"/> all one as to be grieved) <hi>with Iniquity;</hi> and as if it were not more eaſie to find here a ſeigning of a perſon, than to ſhew, that to ſome perſon, and he indeed the moſt high God, it agrees to be a ſeal imprinted on men. Certainly they, who elſe where,<note n="*" place="margin">Ro. <hi>8.26.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</note> will they, nill they, are forced to acknowledge, that groans are improperly attributed to the holy Spirit, have no cauſe, why they will not have grieving figuratively to be aſcribed to it; eſpecially when neither themſelves can properly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe grieving to it, ſeeing that doth not proper befal God.</p>
                        <p>But if they ſay, that that alſo is improperly, and by a Metaphor, ſaid of the holy Spirit, that we are ſealed by it, we anſwer, Although the thing expreſſed by that metaphorical kind of ſpeaking, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in proper words, yet nevertheleſs, the force of our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be the ſame. For it is ſignified, as was ſaid, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit is a certain thing given unto us by God, by which we may be certified of our future redemption, and the happineſs promiſed us. Beſides, although that manner of ſpeaking be metaphoricall, yet it is not ſuch as is fitted to a perſon. For neither is every Metaphor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to every thing. Let there be brought forth but one place either out of profane or ſacred Writers, where ſome one is ſaid to be ſealed with any perſon. Wherefore if the holy Spirit were a perſon, <hi>Paul</hi> would have uſed ſuch a Metaphor, as might have been fitted to a perſon, and had not leſs expreſſed the thing which he here handled, than the word of <hi>ſealing.</hi> He had ſaid, to wit, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit was a ſurety, or undertaker, or hoſtage, or had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the name of earneſt, or pledge: which laſt word is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time by a Metaphor accommodated to perſons. But it is altogether unheard of, that any perſon who is given to another to certifie him of his ſalvation and ſafety, is compared to a ſeal imprinted on him, who is ſecured, or any one ſaid to be ſealed by him. Neither indeed in the places alleaged, doth any thing go before, which gave occaſion to the Apoſtle for ſo bold, yea, abſurd a kind of metaphor, rather then for another, a like fitted to his purpoſe, and more to the perſon. But unuſual metaphors and figures, are not wont to be uſed by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and grave men, unleſs ſpecial occaſion invites them, and leads them thereto; much leſs that they ſpeak ſo abſurdly, without any neceſſity: The ſame we would have alſo ſaid unto them, who ſay theſe things are pronounced of the holy Spirit by a Metonimy or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talepſis, to wit, in reſpect of the gifts which come from hint. For there are alſo other Metalepſis, in ſome manner accommodated to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or at leaſt more in uſe. But unuſual ones are not to be aſcribed to conſiderate men, unleſs it appears that they are led to them by ſome certain occaſion. Although the ſame Adverſaries alſo are bound to excuſe a Metaphor, which would nothing leſs concur with a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſis.</p>
                        <p>In the third place, thoſe places of holy Scripture deſerve to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, in which <hi>the holy Spirit is ſaid to be poured out on men,</hi> ſuch as are theſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28, 29.

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:64944:120"/> in which men are ſaid, <hi>to be baptized in</hi> or <hi>with it,</hi> and its baptiſm is oppoſed to the baptiſm of water uſed by <hi>John,</hi> as it is <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. and the places in the other Evangeliſts anſwering to it; and likewiſe <hi>John</hi> 1.33. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.5, 11, 16. add 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. although there, <hi>to be baptized in one ſpirit,</hi> is taken by ſome, for, to be baptized by one Spirit, &amp; ſo we might ſay, we are baptized by Chriſt, by whom God hath poured out abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly the holy Spirit upon us, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.6. when nevertheleſs otherwiſe, where ever that phraſe, <hi>To be baptized in ſpirit,</hi> is extant, it ſignifies nothing elſe, as all confeſs; than <hi>to be baptized with the ſpirit;</hi> the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>in</hi> among the Greeks being redundant, which hath flowed from an Hebraiſm. For becauſe that which the Greeks expreſs by the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Dative caſe, the Latins by the Ablative, the Hebrews cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs without the Particle prefixed, which is for the moſt part <hi>Be,</hi> that is <hi>In;</hi> therefore it is often retained by the he braiſing Greek Writers, and prefixed to the dative, which alone would have that force. But that thoſe words, <hi>in the holy Spirit,</hi> are elſewhere ſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, eaſily appears by the oppoſite member. For in moſt places, in which it is ſaid, that <hi>John</hi> baptized <hi>with water,</hi> it is in Greek <hi>in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> only in <hi>Luke</hi> 3.16. and <hi>Acts</hi> 11.16. the particle <hi>In</hi> is omitted, and it is ſaid ſimply, and without an Hebraiſm, that he baptized <hi>with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Wherefore the ſame is to be held concerning the place 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. eſpecially when by the thing it ſelf, it may ſufficiently appear, that the Apoſtle would demonſtrate the unity of Believers by this, that all are endued, and filled with the ſame Spirit. Which, that he might the more ſignificantly expreſs, he makes mention alſo of making to drink. For becauſe a man is then fully made partaker of liquor, when he is both waſhed outwardly with it, and as it were immerſed in it, and made to drink it, or if you had rather, drencht, with it, that he may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo inwardly filled with it. Therefore <hi>Paul,</hi> that he might ſignifie, that Chriſtians were every way repleniſhed with the holy Spirit, ſaith, they were ſo made to drink, that they breathed one ſpirit, and were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endued with it: Which agrees with that of Chriſt, who in <hi>John,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting men to the participation of ſo excellent a gift, thus<note n="*" place="margin">

That a man may be ſaid to be anointed with divine Vertue, this very thing ſufficiently ſhews, becauſe Chriſt in that place where he is ſaid to be anointed with the holy Spirit, is ſaid alſo to be anointed with Power, namely, divine. Thoſe things that we have ſaid before, refute the Metonymy, which is feigned to be in theſe kinds of ſpeech. And although if it were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, it would ſhew that the holy Spirit is not the moſt high God. For who can believe, that the holy Writers, in the name of the moſt
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:64944:121"/> high God, would ſo often uſe ſuch Metonymies, and forms of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which not only of themſelves very much abhor from the nature of the ſupream Deity, but the like of which do not readily occur, no not in the names even of other perſons, either in vulgar ſpeech, or in the ſacred Writings.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ninth Argument,</hi> Drawn from thoſe places, which argue ſome partition of the holy Spirit.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BUt yet we muſt not altogether depart from the giving of the holy Spirit. For the manner of its giving, or certain words which in ſome places are added, where there is mention made of that donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yield us yet another argument. For 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.13. We read that, <hi>God hath given us of his Spirit;</hi> which ſignifies, that God hath given not all his Spirit, but ſome part of it, which cannot befal a perſon, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally divine, and ſo the moſt higſt God. For a divine perſon cannot be diſtributed into parts; and, if he were given to any, could not be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but whole.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps ſome will ſay, it is read in the Greek, that God hath given to us, <hi>from or of his Spirit,</hi> which may ſignifie, not that God had indeed given his Spirit it ſelf or ſome part of it, but ſomething flowing from that Spirit. For this is often the force of the particle <hi>from</hi> or <hi>of,</hi> that it ſignifies the efficient cauſe, in which manner all things are ſaid to be <hi>of,</hi> or <hi>from God, Rom.</hi> 11.36. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6. And the holy Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Mary,</hi> to be <hi>of,</hi> or <hi>from the holy Spirit, Matth.</hi> 1.20. But that that interpretation is at no hand to be admitted in this place; firſt, a very like place in the ſame <hi>John,</hi> where the Apoſtle handles the ſame thing, doth demonſtrate. Now that is extant about the end of the third Chapter, where, when he had ſaid, being about chiefly to commend Charity, that he who <hi>keepeth the commandments of God, abideth in him, and he in him;</hi> he adds, <hi>and by this we know, that he abideth in us, by,</hi> or <hi>from the Spirit which he hath given us.</hi> Do you ſee, he ſaith, that God hath given to us the Spirit, to wit, his, and by it it is known, that he abideth in us? Why <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hen ſaith he not the ſame in our place, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.1. where, when he had affirmed, if we love ane another, God abides in us, and his love is perfected in us; he adds, <hi>In this we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe</hi> (or <hi>that) he hath given us of his Spirit.</hi> The very likeneſs of the place evinceth, that <hi>John,</hi> as he there ſaid, that God hath given to us his Spirit, ſo he alſo here ſaith the ſame; except here ſpeaking a little more diſtinctly, he ſheweth, that God hath given to us, not his whole Spirit, but of it, or a part of it. Beſides the thing it ſeif requireth it. For <hi>John</hi> whould and ought to expreſs, what God hath given to us, by which we may certainly know, that God dwells in
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:64944:121"/> us. But he had not expreſſed that, if he had only ſaid, <label type="milestone">

                     <note place="margin">There is given of the Holy Spirit.</note> that God hath given to us from, or of his Spirit, as an efficient cauſe. For what that ſhould be, he had only left it to be gueſſed at by us, and theſentence had been maimed; like as if one ſhould ſay, God hath given to us from, or of himſelf as an efficient cauſe: Which ſpeech had not been worthy a conſidera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e man, much leſs the Apoſtle. But that ſentence, which we have expreſſed, is both perfect, and plainly expreſſeth the thing given, and ſuch indeed as may demonſtrate moſt clearly, that God dwells in us, in ſome moſt ſingular and divine manner, and we in him; and that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e is a moſt ſtrait bond of love, and conjunction between us and him. For, how could we more ſtraitly be joyned with him, or he with us, then when he hath imparted to us of his holy Spirit? The ſame thing which is ſhewed in thoſe words of <hi>John,</hi> is ſhewed alſo in that manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which <hi>Luke,</hi> together with the Greek Tranſlators of the O d Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, uſeth, deſcribing in Greek, the Speech of <hi>Peter,</hi> in which the place is cited out of <hi>Joel, Acts</hi> 2.18, 19. For in ſtead of that which God ſaith to <hi>Joel, I will pour out my Spirit,</hi> it is ſaid in <hi>Peters</hi> words, <hi>I will pour out of my Spirit;</hi> the ſenſe indeed remaining the ſame, but yet ſo expreſſed, that it may be ſignified, That God would pour out not his whole Spirit upon all fleſh, and upon their ſervants and handmaids, but as it were ſome part of it. For there is an immenſe plenty of it with God, which is reſident in him, as in its fountain, but proceeds and flows from him, when, &amp; ſo far, as he will, not otherwiſe than the light from the Sun or that force which they call influence from Stars, or as heat from fire upon things put to it. For, let me be allowed to illuſtrate a thing moſt divine by ſimilitudes, to which you have not unlike ones concerning wiſdom iſſuing from God, in the Author of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom, Chap.</hi> 7.26.27. Therefore as the things mentioned by us, diffuſe their power, and diſtribute it into many ſubjects, and that often unequally, ſo alſo God communicateth his power and virtue to many, and not to all in the ſame meaſure, and the ſame degree; whence there ariſeth ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his power, ſo that no man may wonder, that we following the Scripture, urge ſome partition of the holy Spirit. Although what need is there to defend or excuſe that which the holy Writings do ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſert? For, what is it which the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, Chap.</hi> 2.4. ſaith, <hi>That God confirmed by his teſtimony, the Doctrine of the Goſpel, concerning everlaſting ſalvation, as well by ſignes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and divers miracles,</hi> as alſo <hi>by the diſtributions or diviſions of the holy Spirit,</hi> that is, by diſtributing the holy Spirit among believers, and imparting it to them in various meaſures as it hath pleaſed him? What likewiſe is that which God long ſince ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Num.</hi> 11.17. <hi>I will take off thy Spirit, and put on them,</hi> to wit, the ſeventy Elders? which alſo we ſee was done afterward in the very deed. For ſo we read after <hi>Verſ.</hi> 25. <hi>And took</hi> (the Lord) <hi>of the Spirit which was in Moſes, and gave it to the ſeventy Elders, and when the ſpirit had reſted on them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.9.</note> 
                     <hi>they propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> &amp;c. What moreover that which we read of <hi>Eliſeus,</hi> who would have given to him <hi>a double ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Elias,</hi> or as it is in the <hi>Hebrew, the mouth of two in the ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Elias,</hi> that is a double part of his Spirit, or ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

For there the Father is commanded to give <hi>doubles,</hi> Heb. <hi>the mouth of two,</hi> or a double part of goods to his firſt-born Son, although bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> of the hated wife. Neither truly did <hi>Elizeus</hi> in vain ask for that, as is underſtood by the following words of that place. Moreover <hi>Paul</hi> makes mention alſo of the firſt-fruits of the Spirit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2, 3. Now what elſe are the firſt-fruits of any thing, but the firſt and ſelect parts of it?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, When <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that <hi>God giveth the Spirit not by meaſure, John</hi> 3.34. what other thing would he, than that God gives the Spirit moſt plentifully? But that cannot be ſaid of a thing, which can in no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be encreaſed, nor deminiſhed, nor divided into ſome parts. And ſurely <hi>John</hi> doth tacitely intimate, that God hath given, or doth give the Spirit in ſome certain meaſure: but to Chriſt alone he hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted a certain unmeaſurable plenty of it. But it is not neceſſary for us in this place to ſay all things which pertain to a further explication of thoſe places; that ſhall be done, if God will, elſe where. For it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough now to have ſhewn, that a certian diſtribution doth befal the holy Spirit, which cannot by any means befall a divine perſon, yea, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at all, unleſs with ſome corruption of it. But the diſtribution of the holy Spirit brings no corruption to it.</p>

                     <head>The Defence and Confirmation of the Argument.</head>
                     <p>BUt we have already above, ſhut up this way for eſcape, to wit, that theſe things are to be underſtood of the gift or effect of the holy Spirit, who is a divine perſon. Beſides that it may appear by ſome places,<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. <hi>8.</hi> of this Section.</note> alleaged by us, and the like to them, that that Spirit, of which theſe things are ſaid, is one thing, the gift underſtood by the adverſaries another thing, namely, a quality or motion imprinted on men by a divine ſpirit. See <hi>Numb.</hi> 11 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Compare together <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28, 29. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2. <hi>John</hi> 3.34. That I mention not now the Hiſtory it ſelf, of the effuſion of the holy Spirit, ſet down, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. by which it is manifeſt, that the holy Spirit poured out on the Apoſtles, and diſtributed, is one thing, the gift flowing from thence, another thing. See <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.4. But of the ſame Spirit alſo other places are to be underſtood.</p>
                     <p>Out of the places hitherto brought by us, you may eaſily frame many arguments. For every manner of expreſſion uſed in the teſtimonies, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying either more openly, or more covertly, ſome diviſion of the holy Spirit; may ſupply us with a ſeveral reaſon. For they ſo abhor from the ſupream deity, that no man may da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e to uſe them of it. No ſuch thing ſurely is ſo much as intimated in the holy Scriptures, either of the Father or of the Son. Who hath either heard or dare ſay, that there is
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:64944:122"/> taken of the Father or of Chriſt, that there is given or poured out of him, that he is diſtributed or doubled, that he is given either in meaſure or without meaſure, that any one has the firſt fruits of him, or the firſt and better parts of him? But what other cauſe is there of this thing, then becauſe they are perſons and indeed divine ones; although the latter, not of himſelf, but by the grace and gift of God. Therefore there would be the ſame reaſon of the holy Spirit alſo, if it were likewiſe the moſt high God.</p>

But there is the ſame reaſon of the holy Spirit, as of the Father, if the holy Spirit be the moſt high God. For that therefore cannot be ſaid of God the Father, becauſe he is the moſt high God.

Some prophets uſe a more lofty and figurative ſtyle than the Apoſtles, which is ſeen eſpecially in Pſalmes and ſongs. For they contain ſome kind of verſe, and as is obſerved by learned men, come nearer to the ſtyle of Poets, than to ſpeech in proſe. But you ſhall read no ſuch thing there of God; much leſs ought we to think that the Apoſtle who ſcarce riſeth above common ſpeech, hath in delivering pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, uſed ſo bold and unuſual a figure, if you acknowledge that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit is properly a divine inſpiration, or certain power flowing from God into men; you will eaſily underſtand that that manner of ſpeaking is not at all abſurd.

Beſides, they, who contend that the proceſſion of the holy Spirit, of which Chriſt in <hi>John</hi> ſpeakes, (For there is no where elſe expreſs mention made of it) hath continued from all eternity, and that it ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>all continue to all eternity, have not conſidered that Chriſt ſpeakes of that proceſſion of the holy Spirit, by which it ſhould come to paſs that the holy Spirit ſhould be ſent from him to the diſciples, and moreover come to them. For if you conſider the reſt of the things ſpoken of in the ſame place, you will find no other cauſe, why Chriſt ſaid that the holy Spirit doth proceed from the Father, than that he might declare that which he had ſaid, <hi>whom</hi> (to wit <hi>the Advocate) I will ſend to you from the Father:</hi> neither do the adverſaries ſeem to deny it. But what hath that proceſſion, which continues from eternity to eternity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the ſending and coming of the holy Spirit to the diſciples? yea that would rather hinder this, if by that, the holy Spirit ſhould be the moſt high God, as the adverſaries would have it. I omit that they, (the Greeks onely excepted) hold that the holy Spirit doth proceed eternally no leſs from the Son than from the Father. But Chriſt ſpeaks of a thing, which is proper to the Father. For in this behalf, in ſome ſort he oppoſeth the Father to himſelf, being about to ſhew, why he ſaid, he would ſend the holy Spirit not from himſelf but <hi>from the Father.</hi> But how much more ſimple and plain is it to hold, that the holy Spirit doth ſo far proceed from God, as it is the vertue and efficacy iſſuing
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:64944:124"/> from him into men; than, that the moſt high God, who is but one only, proceeds from another, who is in like manner the moſt high God; that he who is from no cauſe, receives his being from another; that he who hath had moſt fully his Eſſence from Eternity, receives it, and is to receive it yet unto all Eternity.</p>
                  <p>But that the ſame thing which we have ſhewed out of the words of Chriſt, ſet down by <hi>John,</hi> is taught alſo by thoſe words of <hi>Paul,</hi> in which he affirmeth, that the holy Spirit <hi>is of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. For he ſaith, <hi>Now we have received, not the ſpirit of the world, but the ſpirit which is of God.</hi> But whatſoever is of God, is Gods effect and depends on him. But all, as we have ſaid, know, that God is the effect of no thing. Although there is ſcarce need to make mention of effect, it is enough to ſay, that the moſt high God is from none.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>BEcauſe towards the end of the foregoing <hi>Chapter,</hi> we fell into the mention of the place, <hi>John</hi> 16.13. where it is ſpoken of the thing, joyned to the ſending of the holy Spirit; therefore we will here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine it alſo. For there, not only that is affirmed of the holy Spirit, which could not be affirmed of him, if he were the moſt high God, but alſo that is denied, which cannot be by any means denyed of the moſt high God. For, thus Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Howbeit, when he, the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you all into the Truth. For he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, but whatſoever he ſhall hear, that ſhall he ſpeak; and he will ſhew you things to come. He ſhall glorifie me, for he ſhall receive of mine and ſhall ſhew it unto you. All things that the Father hath are mine. Therefore I ſaid</hi> (that) <hi>he ſhall take of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you.</hi> Here it is denied, that the holy Spirit ſpake of himſelf: on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it is affirmed, that he ſhould ſpeak what he heard, and ſhould receive of that which was Chriſts. And the former indeed is therefore chiefly denyed, that it may be ſhewed, that he is rightly called, the Spirit of Truth, that is, moſt true: But this latter is therefore affirmed of him, that it might be ſhewed, that he ſhould glorifie Chriſt. But the moſt high God, whatſoever he ſpeaks, ſpeaks of himſelf, and for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing he is true, becauſe he ſpeakes of himſelf. He doth not alſo hear what he ſhould ſpeak, nor is inſtructed, like an Embaſſador, by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther He receiveth nothing from any, yea, he beſtoweth of his own upon all. He hath not glorified Chriſt by receiving ſomething from him, but by giving to him. How then is the holy Spirit the moſt high God?</p>
                  <p>It will not be amiſs to cite here the words of <hi>John Maldonate,</hi> a moſt learned Interpreter of the Papiſts, who hath in part unfolded this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, ſpeaking in this manner: But (Chriſt) gives the reaſon, as <hi>Rupertus</hi> ſaith, why he called him the Spirit of Truth, <hi>becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf;</hi> as if, if he ſhould ſpeak of himſelf, he ſhould ſpeak not truth, but a lye. Which, how true it is, it doth not enough appear, ſeeing he rather therefore ſpeaks truth, and cannot ſpeak falſe, becauſe he ſpeaks of himſelf. For when he ſpeaks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he ſpeaks as God, ſince he is nothing elſe but God. But when he ſpeaks as God, he cannot lye, which if he could do, then truly could he do it when he ſpeaks not of himſelf, that is, not as God. Therefore <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Bede</hi> queſtion how it may be underſtood, that he ſpeakes
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64944:125"/> not of himſelf. For if there were a double nature in the holy Spirit, as in Chriſt, one a divine, the other a humane, or any other; we might perhaps ſay, that then he ſpeakes not of himſelf when he ſpeakes as man, as we interpret what Chriſt ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.4. <hi>The words which I ſpeak to you I ſpeak not of my ſelf;</hi> and what he ſaid before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.16. <hi>My doctrine is not mine but his that ſent me.</hi> But ſince the holy Spirit is but one, and that a divine nature, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> diſputes, we cannot ſay it; and thus far he. It were even to be wiſhed to the adverſaries in this place, that a double nature could be feigned in the holy Spirit alſo, as is done in Chriſt, that they might looſe this knot. By what hole then do they endeavour to eſcape, when there is none? The foreſaid interpreter brings a double anſwer, <q>One of <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and <hi>Bede,</hi> ano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>her his own. The firſt is, therefore the holy Spirit is ſaid not to ſpeak of himſelf, becauſe neither is he from himſelf, as therefore ſaith he, he is not of himſelf, but he proceeds from the Father and Son, ſo he ſhall not ſpeak, but what he hath received from the Father and Son by proceeding from them: as a little after he ſaith, <hi>He ſhall glorifie me, for he ſhall receive of mine.</hi>
                     </q> But when the foreſaid Interpreter had come to thoſe words, he clearly enough confutes this explication of this place. The commonly received opinion of latter Interpreters ſaith <q>he, is this, <hi>For he ſhall receive of mine,</hi> that is, he proceeds from me. Concerning which thing I find here many ſubtletys in ſome Writers, I know not how ſolid, and agreeable to the matter, which I will not ſo much as recite. I onely ſay, I am fully perſwaded, that this is not the ſenſe. For why did he not ſay more clearly, he ſhall receive <hi>of me</hi> or <hi>from me?</hi> Why, not, <hi>he hath recieved,</hi> rather than, <hi>he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> ſince the proceſſion of the holy Spirit from the Father and Son was not future, but already paſt? For although I know an anſwer is made by ſome to theſe things, yet I had rather ſay nothing, than ſay that<note n="*" place="margin">and what is it elſe than that the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is to proceed from the Father and Son unto all eternity.</note> which they ſay; Beſides how can it co-here with that interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, All things which the Father hath are mine; therefore I have ſaid, that he ſhall receive of mine? Laſtly, here the matter was of the teſtimony which the holy Spirit was to give of Chriſt, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was to glorifie him: Which ought to be conſpicuous and manifeſt; otherwiſe, how could he for that glorifie Chriſt? But that eſſential proceſſion was not conſpicuous: Therefore it could not be brought as an argument, whence the diſciples might gather, that the works of the holy Spirit did redoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to the glory of Chriſt,</q> For this was to glorifie him. There is no need of more words for the refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this interpretation, which ſo much diſpleaſed a Papiſt, and him moſt addicted to the opinions of his Church, and which he ſaw could not be defended unleſs thoſe things be ſaid which he judged unworthy even to be mentioned by him. Although alſo that interpretation being admitted, it can nevertheleſs be evinced, that the holy Spirit is not the moſt high God, ſince the moſt high God, as we have a little<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. <hi>11</hi> of this Section.</note> before ſeen, Proceeds from none, receives his Eſſence from none. The ſame interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little after ſubjoyns his own opinion touching this thing. <q>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaith he, the true interpretation is, <hi>that he ſhall receive of mine,</hi>
                        <pb n="231" facs="tcp:64944:125"/> that is, becauſe he ſhall come in my name, becauſe as my deputy he ſhall del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>er no other doctrine to you than mine. For therefore the glory of his work and doctrine ſhall redound to my glory, which is to glorifie me, becauſe he ſhall deliver in my name, and no othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> than my miſteries to you, he ſhall do no other than my works. For with this ſenſe that which followes, doth fitly agree. <hi>All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore I ſaid he ſhall receive of mine</hi> as we ſhall preſently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it. Therefore he ſaid by the future tenſe, <hi>he ſhall receive,</hi> becauſe to receive of him is to be ſent in his name, and as it were, commands being received from him; and he had not been yet ſent. Therefore he ſaid <hi>of mine,</hi> not <hi>of me,</hi> becauſe he would ſignify, that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of his doctrine and workes whatſoever he ſhould teach, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſhould do among men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What then doth that Interpreter himſelf anſwer? or,<note place="margin">A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth he think thoſe things, <hi>he ſhall receive of mine,</hi> can be ſaid of the holy Spirit, if he himſelf be the moſt high God? <q>Not, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> that himſelf had not the ſame things before; but becauſe, as <hi>Cyril</hi> ſaith, he ſpeaks accommodately to humane ſence. For Embaſſadours are wont, when they depart from the Prince, to receive commands, both what they ſhall ſpeak, and what they ſhall do.</q> But to thoſe words, ver. 13. he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, <q>We may more ſimply (<hi>to wit, than</hi> Auguſtin <hi>and</hi> Bede <hi>had anſwered</hi>) ſay it is no other thing not to ſpeak of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, than not to ſpeak contrary things to thoſe which he himſelf had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the will of the Father.</q> For which opinion,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>John</hi> 7.16 <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.10.</note> he cites ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Authors: and adds, <hi>For in the ſame manner we expounded what he had ſaid, My Doctrine is not mine; and the words which I ſpeak to you, I ſpeak not of my ſelf.</hi> So alſo he intimates, that thoſe words alſo, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſhall hear, he ſhall ſpeak,</hi> are to be taken in ſuch manner as he had taken that of Chriſt, <hi>As I hear, I judge;</hi> and that, <hi>I ſpeak thoſe things in the world which I have heard of him;</hi> to wit, that Chriſt did neither judge any thing, nor ſhould at any time ſpeak any thing, but what he did or ſhould know to be agreeable to his Fathers mind and will: ſo therefore, that neither the holy Spirit ſhould ſpeak any thing from himſelf, becauſe he ſhould ſpeak nothing but what he ſhould know to be agreeing with the mind and will of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch an interpretation of Chriſts words, is not every way to be admitted, nor doth it altogether take away the difficulty. For as to the former, thoſe former words, <hi>He ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf,</hi> and thoſe that are oppoſed to them, <hi>but what he ſhall hear, he ſhall ſpeak,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken of only a bare conſent with Chriſts words, but do alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſignifie, that he of whom thoſe things are ſaid; is not the firſt author of his words, but that ſome other is the Author of them. For otherwiſe it might be ſaid, that neither the Father indeed had ſpoken of himſelf, becauſe he had ſpoken nothing but what the Son hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, nor the Son, even in reſpect of the holy Spirit; becauſe, as the opinion of the Adverſaries is, the Son ſpake nothing but what the perſon of the holy Spirit conſented to. But all ſee that thoſe things are abſurd. Add, that that ſame Interpreter not only confeſſeth it,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:64944:126"/> but alſo urgeth it, that the holy Spirit is here looked upon as Chriſts Legate; that which the very context of the words ſufficiently ſhews. To the propriety of this Embaſſage, nothing can be wanting, if the holy Spirit be a perſon. Wherefore thoſe words, <hi>He ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, and whatſoever he ſhall hear, he ſhall ſpeak;</hi> and likewiſe, <hi>He ſhall receive of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you,</hi> are ſo to be taken, as they agree to a Legate. But they ſo agree to a Legate, that he be not himſelf the firſt Author of his words, but only that anothers words and mandates be declared by him to them, unto whom he is ſent. And indeed, to a Legate, properly ſo called, ſuch as the holy Spirit would be, if he were a perſon, it belongs properly to be inſtructed with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands from another, and to bring to others, and expound to them, his received will and mind. For a Legate, as ſuch, is anothers Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and the Interpreter of anothers will. But that he ſaith, thoſe words in ver. 14.15. <hi>He ſhall receive of mine,</hi> are ſpoken accommodate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to humane ſence; if he mean this, that he ſhould indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing from Chriſt; becauſe he alwayes had all things; but that it ſhould ſeem ſo to men, what elſe doth he, but to elude Chriſts words? as if, forſooth, Chriſt ſpake of it, what men, however falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhould imagine concerning that matter, and not rather, what ſhould truly be, though there may be ſome figure in the words. Do we think that Chriſt would have ſaid, that the holy Spirit ſhould glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him, becauſe men ſhould falſely think, that the holy ſpirit recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of that which is Chriſts? Or do we think that he would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for his glory, the glory that is founded in the vain opinion of men; and beſides, that pertaineth to ſome deminution of the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the holy Spirit; that is, as it pleaſeth them of the moſt high God? But if he mean that, that the holy Spirit ſhould indeed truly receive ſomething of that which is Chriſts, but yet that a figure or trope fetcht from humane things, is in the word of <hi>receiving,</hi> let him ſtrain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as he will, and turn himſelf every way, He ſhall ſhew by no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that it can be ſaid, that he ſhall receive from another, that he ſhall ſpeak not from himſelf, but things heard from another, who is firſt author of his words, and to whom thoſe words are not deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or ſome way wrought or imprinted by another at a certain time. Although beſides, if the holy Spirit were no leſs properly the Legate of the Son, than the Son formerly of the Father, no impropriety of ſpeech, which might here be of any moment in that matter of which it is here diſputed, is to be admitted, either in the word of hearing, or of <hi>receiving.</hi> For it will be altogether ſignified, that thoſe things which the holy Spirit hath ſaid, were manifeſted and committed to him by Chriſt. For that belongs to ſuch a Legate as Chriſt was, and ſuch a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>By which it is now underſtood, that the difficulty is not taken away by ſuch an anſwer, nor our Argument ſolved; becauſe what ever you deviſe, theſe words cannot conſiſt, unleſs it be acknowledged, that the holy Spirit is not the firſt author of thoſe things which he made known to the Diſciples of Chriſt, but it came to paſs by the will of

                  <p>But perhaps this ſcruple will trouble ſome, how it can be that the holy Spirit may be ſaid to hear, and to receive from another, what he may declare to others, if it be but only a divine inſpiration, or virtue and efficacy?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Since the Adverſaries alſo confeſs, and the thing it ſelf ſhews, that thoſe things cannot be properly taken concerning the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, there is no neceſſity that we ſhould ſhew, that they may be taken properly concerning divine inſpiration. But if a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the words is to be admitted, it is not hard to ſhew, that they may be rightly and elegantly ſaid concerning divine inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or virtue inſpired from heaven into the Apoſtles. Out of thoſe things w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ich follow, it will be manifeſt that many things are found in the holy Scripture, ſpoken by a Proſopopoea, concerning the holy Spirit, as alſo concerning other things. And that this figure is abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the place of <hi>John,</hi> of which we treat, ſhall be by and by ſhewn. All men perceive that it is here ſpoken of the holy Spirit as of a Legate, who is to be ſent by Chriſt to the diſciples. It belongs to a Legate, as we have ſaid before, not to ſpeak of himſelf, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to others the commands heard and received from him by whom he is ſent. Theſe things then are accommodated, and that by right, alſo to the divine vertue, long ſince inſpired into the Apoſtles. For there is ſomething in that divine inſpiration, which very well anſwers to hearing and receiving from another, and declaring, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, hath made way for the Metaphor, out of which the Proſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popoea ariſeth. For not the divine inſpiration, but he from whom that inſpiration comes, is the true author of thoſe things, which are revealed by it to men; neither can that divine virtue implant any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing in the ſpirits and minds of men, than he would from whom it is inſpired into men; who is here indeed Chriſt. Therefore it is like to ſome Legate, who declares nothing ſave the things heard, and received from his Prince and Lord, to thoſe to whom he is ſent. But why doth here Chriſt ſpeak by Proſopopey, concerning the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, this is chiefly the cauſe, becauſe in ſome manner he compares him with himſelf, and conſiders him as it were to be ſent into his place to the Diſciples now ſadned by his inſtant departure. For Chriſt hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hath been, as it were their Comforter. Therefore he ſaid to them (being fadned by the notice of his departure) That he, asking the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, would give to them, or would ſend to them, from the Father, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Comforter, who might abundantly ſupply his room in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.

                  <p>Hence alſo aroſe that famous Proſopopey in <hi>Solomon,</hi> who brings in wiſdom and fooliſhneſs contrary to it, as certain women inviting men to them, by reaſon of the compariſon of a ſtrange woman, as moſt learned men have noted. (See <hi>Cornelius Janſen</hi> on the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs</hi>) Let the whole place be read, beginning at <hi>Proverbs</hi> 7.5. where that compariſon begins and is continued through the reſt of the whole chapter, and the two following Chapters. Compare alſo with this place, <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>More might be ſaid of this matter, but there is now no place for it, and ſomething alſo ſhall yet be ſaid hereafter, by which it ſhall appear, that no man ought to marvel, that ſuch a Proſopopey, or Fiction of a Perſon, is uſed concerning the holy Spirit. Although even that alone may take away wondring from any one, that Chriſt himſelf confeſſeth, that he in that ſpeech of his, in which ſeveral times he brings in the holy Spirit as a perſon, ſpake to the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in Parables or Figures fetcht from common uſe; but that ſometimes he would openly and plainly declare to them of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or of the things pertaining to the Father, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.25: But among thoſe things, even chiefly is the holy Spirit, of whom there is often mention in that diſcourſe, one while more openly, another while more covertly. Chriſt afterwards indeed explained the thing clearly enough, when he poured out the holy Spirit on the Diſciples, by which he lead them into all the Truth. For <hi>it,</hi> not as a true perſon, hath declared any thing to them, but as a divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration inſpired into their minds, hath wrought and imprinted in them the fulleſt knowledge of the Doctrine of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, ſince the event it ſelf hath ſufficiently explained that Diſcourſe, why do we ſeek another Interpretation?</p>

                  <p>THe fourth place in this rank, we ſhall aſſigne to thoſe words of <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. which the Adverſaries are wont to uſe to prove, that the holy Spirit is a divine perſon. For thus the Apoſtle there ſpeaks: <hi>But God hath revealed them to us</hi> (to wit, thoſe things which God hath prepared for them who love him) <hi>by his Spirit. For the Spirit ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, even the deep things of God. For who of men knoweth the things of man, ſave the ſpirit of man that is in him? Even ſo the things of God knoweth none, but the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the Spirit of this world, but the ſpirit which is of God,</hi> &amp;c. This place yeelds us divers Arguments, ſome of which are above alleaged by us in <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pirit is diſtinguiſhed from God, whileſt <hi>God</hi> is ſaid, <hi>by him to reveal to us</hi> the things of ſalvation, whileſt it is called <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> whileſt it is aſſerted, that <hi>he ſearcheth the deep things of God,</hi> and <hi>hath known the things which are of God,</hi> whileſt, in the end,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.</note> it is ſaid <hi>to be of God.</hi> Moreover, that men are ſaid to receive it. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that when he is ſaid <hi>to be of God,</hi> he is made the effect of God. But none of theſe, we have ſhewed, can befal the moſt high God. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe three, as many other Arguments may be fetcht from the ſame words.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, That <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to have revealed ſomething to us <hi>by his Spirit.</hi> For thence it is manifeſt, that it is not the firſt but the middle cauſe of that Revelation, which agrees not to the moſt high God. See what we have ſaid in thoſe places above, <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. in which God is ſaid to have done either all or certain things by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, That it is ſaid <hi>to ſearch even the deep things of God.</hi> For neither is any one ſaid to ſearch thoſe things, the moſt clear and perfect knowledge of which is firſt in him, and which are by him firſt conſtituted and decreed. But if the holy Spirit is the moſt high God, the deep things of God, that is, his hidden counſels, and moſt clear and perfect knowledge thereof, in him is firſt reſident, and by him they are all firſt conſtituted and decreed. How then could he be ſaid to ſearch them? God and Chriſt indeed is ſaid to ſearch our hearts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he penetrates into the ſecrets of anothers breaſt, but his own counſels, his own deep things, he is no where ſaid to ſearch. Indeed neither are men ſaid to ſearch their own counſels, unleſs perhaps, when either they are by ſome means ſlipt out of their memory, or they themſelves have not yet ſufficiently examined the reaſon of them.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64944:128"/> But what can be wanting to the moſt high God, for the moſt exact knowledge of his depths? <label type="milestone">

                        <hi>From</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10.</note> The Apoſtle in this place being about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that which he had ſaid of the Spirit of God by the example of the Spirit of man, doth not ſay, that it ſearcheth, but <hi>knows</hi> the things which are of a man, although the manner of ſpeaking, which he had uſed of the Spirit of God, would lead him thereto, that he ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that the ſpirit of man alſo ſearcheth thoſe things, which are of a man. But he would not affirm it of the Spirit of man, becauſe in it firſt are reſident thoſe things which are of a man, that is, his counſels and decrees, and by it are conſtituted. Therefore the ſame reaſon ſhould be of the holy Spirit, if he were the moſt high God. We know indeed that it is ſaid by a Metalepſis which alſo brings forth a certain Proſopopey, that the Spirit of God ſearcheth all things, namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cauſeth men, in whom it is, to find out all things, even the deep and hidden counſels of God. In which manner the ſame Spirit is ſaid to intercede for us with unutterable groans, and to cry <hi>Abba</hi> Father; becauſe it is the cauſe, that we may do theſe things. But the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries cannot uſe this anſwer, who endeavour to frame the perſon of the holy Spirit from this, that the holy Spirit is ſaid to know all things, even thoſe which are of God; which they could not do, if they would acknowledge thoſe things to be ſaid of the holy Spirit by a Metalepſis. For it would no more thence follow, that the holy Spirit is a perſon, than that Charity is a perſon, becauſe ſo many actions proper to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are attributed to it by a Metalepſis, afterward in the ſame Epiſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Moreover ſuch a Metalepſis would be altogether unuſual, if the holy Spirit ſhould be the moſt high God. Who would ſay that the Father ſearcheth the counſel of God, becauſe he may cauſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſearch them? Why then ſhould the holy Spirit be ſaid to ſearch the deep things of God, if he himſelf were the moſt high God, whoſe are thoſe deep things? We ſay the ſame words of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8.27. which we touched a little before; <hi>The Spirit it ſelf askes</hi> (or makes interceſſion) <hi>for us with unutterable groans, and he that ſearcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, becauſe he maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for the Saints, according to God.</hi> For how could theſe things be ſaid, even by a Metalepſis of the holy Spirit, if he were the moſt high God, with whom the interceſſion is made, and who ſearcheth the hearts, and according to whom, or according to whoſe will the Saints intercede? For it is not convenient, that not only humane action ſhould be attributed to the moſt high God, but that his own perſon alſo ſhould be detracted from him.</p>
                  <p>The third Argument, which may be drawn from the aforeſaid place to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> is, that if the holy Spirit were a perſon diſtinct from the Father and Son, which, ſpeaking p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But the adverſaries, who would have the knowledge in this place to be properly attributed to the holy Spirit himſelf, cannot ſay that, and are forced to confeſs, that the holy Spirit is therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly excepted, becauſe otherwiſe he ſhould be alto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For nothing is wont to be excepted from out of a general ſpeech, but what otherwiſe is of the ſame kind of things, of which it is ſpoken, and which, therefore, unleſs it had been excepted, had been altogether cemprehended in the general ſpeech, and the ſame thing either affirmed or denyed of it, as of the reſt. Wherefore if the knowledge of divine things be here properly aſcribed to the holy Spirit himſelf, as the Adverſaries would, and that Metonymy which we have explained, is not to be acknowledged in that word, the word <hi>none</hi> cannot be reſtrained to men or creatu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Whence it followes, ſeeing the holy Spirit in their opinion is a perſon really diſtinct from the Father and Son; that the Father and Son are excluded from the knowledge of vine things in theſe words of <hi>Paul;</hi> of which abſurdity there is no danger in our opinion. In the ſame manner, if the Spirit of a man were a certain perſon diſtinct from the man himſelf, whoſe Spirit it is ſaid to be, when it is denyed, that any <hi>of men knowes thoſe things which are of a man beſides his ſpirit;</hi> the man himſelf whoſe Spirit it is, had been excluded: and beſides that exception ſhould have been rediculous. <hi>What man knowes the things,</hi> which are of a man, <hi>unleſs the Spirit of man which is in him?</hi> For is the Spirit of man, which is in him, man? But if you take the words of the Apoſtle, as if he had ſaid, No man knowes the hidden counſels, and thoughts of a man beſides himſelf, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives and underſtands them by his Spirit and mind; the abſurdity will ceaſe. For it is to be obſerved, what Philoſophy teacheth namely, that not the Spirit of a man, which they call the ſoul, doth properly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, but the man by it, or by its vertue or power.</p>

                  <p>IN the laſt place it likes me to alleage that, to which many adverſaries attribute much, when they endeavour to ſhew, that the holy Spirit is not a divine vertue, but a perſon diſtinct from the Father and Son. And that is, as <hi>Luke</hi> writes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.22. With whom alſo the other writers of the Goſpel Hiſtory agree, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.32, 33. That <hi>the holy Spirit deſcended on Chriſt, baptized by John, in a corporal ſhape, as a dove.</hi> It is an old ſaying, and at this day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſpoken among the adverſaries, Go <hi>Arian</hi> to <hi>Jordan,</hi> and thou ſhalt ſee the Trinity. Surely, if the Trinity be Father Son and holy Spirit; The Father indeed, who inhabiting in Heaven as the moſt high God, and removed from mens eyes, commandeth them out of his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority, and on the Son beſtows authourity from his Majeſty, but the Son a true man, baptized in <hi>Jordan</hi> by <hi>John,</hi> and after from heaven annoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We may indeed rightly ſend thither the <hi>Arians;</hi> who hold that the Son of God is a certain inviſible Spirit produced by God before the creation of the world: but our adverſaries who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him to be conſubſtantial, it is ſo far of, their being able to do it, that the <hi>Arians</hi> rather might ſend them thither. For the tenet of the <hi>Arians</hi> is leſs againſt that Hiſtory, than that of the Conſubſtantialiſts. But we will
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64944:129"/> not in this place urge all things, which might be ſaid, but that onely, which is written of the holy Spirit; that we may not only, wreſt out the weapon of the hands of the Adverſaries, with which they f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ght a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, but alſo may retort it on them. They urge that the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath both decended, and appeared in bodily ſhape, to wit, of a dove. For from thence it follows, that the holy Spirit is ſome ſubſtance, not a quality. For it belongs to ſubſtances, and thoſe only that are <hi>Suppoſitums</hi> to deſcend, and to aſſume and ſuſtain formes and ſhapes; and together they ſay it appeares, that the holy Spirit is ſuch a ſubſtance, as is really diſtinct from the Father and Son. For neither the Father or Son deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from heaven, nor aſſumed that corporeal form, therefore the holy Spirit is a <hi>Suppoſitum;</hi> and conſequently becauſe alſo he is intelligent (For he is ſaid to ſearch all things, even the depths of God, and to know the things that are Gods, and other like things, proper to intelligent Subſtances, are pronounced of it) he is alſo a perſon, for every intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>Suppoſitum</hi> is a perſon. Since that is the definition of a perſon. There is need of ſo much furniture, that the perſon of the holy Spirit may be framed hence, which they promiſed we ſhould ſee at <hi>Jordan</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with two others. For neither the Trinity of the adverſaries can be ſeen, unleſs three perſons can be ſeen, and ſo as that it may appear they are perſons. What is to be anſwered to this their Argumentation ſhall be a little after ſhewed. Let us do now that which we propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that aſſuming thoſe things which partly are read in that ſacred Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, partly are affimed by the adverſaries, we may demoſtrate the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit not to be the moſt high God. They affirme, if the holy Spirit be the moſt high God, that he ought to be altogether of the ſame eſſence with the Father; yea, a ſo with the Son. Otherwiſe there will be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two or more moſt high Gods, or the Father or Son, whom they take for the moſt high God, will not be the moſt high God. But from this apparition of the holy Spirit, it is manifeſt, that there is one Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the holy Spirit, another of the Father and Son. For the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Father and Son deſcended not then from heaven when Chriſt was baptized, nor took that corporeal ſhape, the Eſſence of the holy Spirit, as is manifeſt by the adverſaries opinion, did both. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the holy Spirit is not the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the Father or Son, but it is neceſſary <hi>this</hi> to be one, <hi>that</hi> to be another. Neither indeed may they ſay, that not the Eſſence of the holy Spirit, but the perſon did both. For firſt every perſon is a ſubſtance, and a ſubſtance is an Eſſence ſubſiſting by it ſelf. Wherefore whoſe perſon deſcended, and aſſumed ſome form, his eſſence alſo doth it. And beſides do not they themſelves, as we have ſeen urge, that that which deſcends and ſuſtaines a form, is neceſſarily a ſubſtance? But the ſubſtance of the holy Spirit, is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than its Eſſence, and with our Adverſaries it is all one to ſay, the ſame is the Eſſence, and the ſame is the ſubſtance of the divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to wit, becauſe every ſubſtance is an eſſence, therefore the Eſſence of the holy Spirit muſt have deſcended. And although at laſt a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Deity, ſhould not be the ſubſtance or Eſſence it ſelf, but ſomething in the Eſſence, which yet is impoſſible (For it is repugnant
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64944:130"/> to the nature of a <hi>Suppoſitum,</hi> and further alſo of a perſon to be in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother) yet might not that either deſcend or aſſume a form, but that its ſubſtance in which laſtly all the accidents are and reſt together, ſhould do the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Beſides alſo another ſhorter way from that, that the holy Spirit deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from heaven upon Chriſt, &amp; that in a bodily forme or ſhape, we may ſhew, that he is not the moſt high God. For the moſt God is not moved from place to place, and conſequently deſcends not from heaven. Alſo no accident befalls the moſt high God, even by the adverſaries opinion. But that bodily ſhape in which the holy Spirit deſcended, was an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as alſo that deſcent it ſelf.</p>

                     <p>Some adverſaries, obſerving this, ſo explain the thing, that it may ſufficiently appear, that they neither attribute to the holy Spirits deſcent, properly called, nor grant that he Aſſumed that bodily ſhape on himſelf; but either that a certain true body in a doves ſhape deſcended from heaven, or the ſhape only of a dove deſcending, was repreſented to the eyes of the beholders, which might be a ſimbole or reſemblance of the preſence, and operation of the holy Spirit filling Chriſt with gifts neceſſary for the diſcharge of his prophetical office. But if this be ſo, how will hence be ſhewed, that the holy Spirit is a thing ſubſiſtent by it ſelf, and conſequently a <hi>Suppoſitum</hi> and perſon really diſtinct from the Father, and the Son, ſeeing he neither properly deſcended on Chriſt, nor ſuſtained that forme: but was only the ſhape of a body ſet before the eyes of the beholders, when indeed there was no body: or, as the<note n="*" place="margin">See Maldonat and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine cited by him.</note> opinion is of ſome of the moſt learned adverſaries, a true body which deſcended and ſuſtained that ſhape. But even things which not onely are not perſons, but not ſo much as indeed ſuſtbances may be ſaid to deſcend improperly from heaven; and among others, <hi>James</hi> ſaith chap. 1.17. <hi>Every good, and perfect gift is from above</hi> (that is from heaven) <hi>deſcending from the Father of lights:</hi> But that the ſame may be ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed by a certain outward ſhape, and ſet before the eyes of men, as beſides other things that teacheth, which we read, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.3. of the firſt effuſion of the holy Spirit on Chriſts diſciples. For thoſe cloven tongues did they not expreſs the faculty of diverſe languages to be given to the diſciples of Chriſt by the holy Spirit? But nothing prohibites that they might not ſeem to be moved. How many ſuch ſhapes of things do we ſee ſet before one while the <hi>outward,</hi> another while the <hi>inward ſenſes</hi> of the Prophets? Therefore nothing, if the thing be ſo explained, may be hence gathered, which belongs to prove the holy Spirit to be a <hi>Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> much leſs a perſon. Beſides, although they would have all thoſe things concerning the holy Spirit to be taken figuratively, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they muſt hold, that here ſome ſingular operation of the holy Spirit was ſhaddowed, not of the Father or Son, or at leaſt not equally.</p>

                     <p>For otherwiſe, why ſhould not the Father and Son alſo be ſaid to have deſcended in a bodily ſhape? But if the Eſſence of the holy Spirit would be the ſame with that of the Father and Son, the operation no leſs of theſe than of that, had been expreſſed by that ſhape and deſcent; and ſo the Father and Son, ſhould be no leſs ſaid to have deſcended in a bodily ſhape than the holy Spirit. For ſuch an operation is of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſubſtance it ſelf, having in it ſelf all fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ce of opperating. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing this is ſuppoſed the ſame in thoſe three perſons, the ſame opperation alſo is equally to be attributed to all thoſe perſons. Seeing this is not come to paſs, it follows, that there is one eſſence of the holy Spirit, another of the Father and Son, and conſequently, unleſs the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries would introduce more Gods, or deny the Father to be the moſt high God, they are forced to acknowledge the holy Spirit not to be the moſt high God.</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay, How nevertheleſs do thoſe things agree to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, to deſcend from heaven in a bodily ſhape, if it be only a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine virtue and efficacy, not a <hi>Suppoſitum</hi> or Perſon? This although it properly pertain not to the matter in hand, yet we will briefly explain that no ſcruple may remain.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, we have already ſeen, that ſome of the adverſaries, by the force of their own opinion, are forced to hold, that thoſe things are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſaid of the holy Spirit, but that bodily ſhape and its deſcent from heaven, was only an outward reſemblance of the holy Spirit, filling Chriſt with his gifts, which ſame thing, why it may not be ſaid of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine efficacy, there is no cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, If we would by all means have it ſo, that thoſe things are properly ſpoken of the holy Spirit, it is to be underſtood, as to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent and motion, that the qualities were moved together with their ſubjects, and conſequently in them. Wherefore alſo the divine efficacy, if it may exiſt in a man, and in him, or together with him, be moved, it may deſcend from heaven in another thing likewiſe, which God will uſe in the carrying down of it. Neither indeed is there wanting to God a convenient and beſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ming Vehicle, that I may ſo ſpeak, for that efficacy. But as to the ſhape, it the ſubject of thar efficacy have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhape, eſpecially ſuch as may ſhew and reſemble the latent efficacy, nothing at all hinders but that it may be ſaid, that that virtue deſcends in or with that ſhape. But of theſe things, if God will, we ſhall ſay more elſe where.</p>
                     <p>This we would have here obſerved, although it be written, that the holy ſpirit did then deſcend on Chriſt in a bodily form, and it may be eaſily underſtood, that which all ſeem commonly to think, that it appeared in ſome bodily form on the day of Pentecoſt; yet neither here nor elſe where, is it ever ſaid to have appeared in the ſhape and form of any perſon, as we read of the Father and Chriſt, when they appeared in a certain form, and alſo of the Angels. But if the holy Spirit were a perſon, Why had it not alſo appeared in the ſhape of a perſon? For whether you hold it to have been the ſhape of a Dove, in which it deſcended on Chriſt, as commonly all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64944:131"/> or any other; it is certain that was not the form of a perſon. For neither is the Fire or Dove a Perſon, ſeeing a perſon is nothing but a ſubſtance endued with underſtanding. As for that whereby from the Apoſtles words, in which it is ſaid, it ſearcheth or knows, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to evince, the holy Spirit to be endued with underſtanding, it is refuted in the foregoing Chapter.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Concluſion of the firſt Book, in which it is ſhewed,</hi> That the Adverſaries opinion, concerning the Trinity, is refuted by the very ſilence of the holy Scriptures, neither doth any thing hinder, but that it may be oppugned by Arguments fetcht from Reaſon.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>VVE have ſhewed enough out of holy writ, that neither Chriſt, nor the holy Spirit, but only the Father is the moſt high God; and that the moſt high God is one, as in Eſſence, ſo alſo in perſon; not, as it is commonly believed, three in reſpect of perſons. Which opinion, although there were not ſo many reaſons as we have produced, might be refelled, by the bare ſilence of holy Scriptures. For is it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible that Chriſt and the Apoſtles, that I may omit now the Prophets, would have concealed a thing, as it is commonly believed, and as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the tenet holds forth, ſo neceſſary to be known, ſo hard to be believed, and far exceeding all the capacity of humane wit? Doth not the thing it ſelf ſhew us, by how much that tenet ſhould be more neceſſary both to be known, and more hard to be perceived, by ſo much the clearer they would have propounded it, and ſo the oftenner and more diligently have inculcated it? Their diligence in other things, much leſs and eaſier to be perceived, compels us to believe, as well as the earneſt deſire, or rather endeavour of the ſame perſons, towards the Salvation of mankind; and alſo that office which they undertook and ſuſtained.</p>
                  <p>Shall we think Chriſt, our Saviour, the Apoſtles &amp; other divine men had leſs care of the Salvation of men, than they who either heretofore have defended that tenet, as the cheife concern of our Salvation, or at this day maintain it? Was there in them leſs intelligence of that myſtery, which they commonly adore, or were words wanting, by which they ſhould deſcribe it? Could <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his Creed expreſs it more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than Chriſt, than the Apoſtles? <q>Whoſoever (ſaith he) will be ſaved, before all things, it is neceſſary that he hold the Chatolick faith, which unleſs a man keep whole and inviolate, without doubt he ſhall periſh for ever. But the Catholick faith is this, that we worſhip one God in Trinity and Trinity in Unity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither confounding the perſons, nor ſeperating the ſubſtance. For there is one perſon of the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:64944:131"/> Farher, another of the Son, another of the holy Spirit.<note place="margin">The Scripture doth not teach that God is trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>une.</note> But there is one divinity of the Father, Son, and holy Spirit, equal glory, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternal Majeſty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> What, I beſeech you, is there like theſe things in all the holy Scriptures? We will not now refute the errors of them, who beleeve not all things neceſſary to ſalvation, to be contained in the holy Scriptures, which is done by our men<note n="*" place="margin">See John Volkeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, lib. <hi>5.</hi> Chap. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note> elſewhere. This onely we ſay, that, however ſome poſitions neceſſary to ſalvation ſhould not be contained in the holy Scriptures; yet this, which is made the cheif, and as it were the foundation of other things by them, that it is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly contained there, is to be judged altogether incredible. But letting theſe paſs, let us deal with them, who acknowledge, and urge, that all things, which are neceſſary to ſalvation, are comprehended in the compaſs of the ſacred Volumnes. What reaſon will they aleage, why that tenet is not plainly contained in holy Scripture? Not few ſay, that though it be not expreſly comprehended in them, yet it may be deduced from them by a good conſequence. But, that I may now omit other things, we have ſhewed a little before, that in ſo hard a thing, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more from our capacity, ſo neceſſary there ſhould be fully ſhewn, not onely conſequences, but clear and diſtinct explication, and that repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more than once; eſpecially becauſe ſimple men, to whom God would have the way of ſalvation to be manifeſt equally, that I ſay not, more to learned and ingenious men, underſtand not thoſe conſequences; and beſides muſt take paines not onely in perceiving the reaſon of the conſequence, but alſo in the force of the opinion it ſelf, which is ſcarce perceived by the learned: if yet that may be perceived, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, if they ſpeak true, who ſay, that the Tenet of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, pertains even chiefly to the Catholick Faith, without which no man can be ſaved, ruder men muſt deſpaire of ſalvation. For if to believe, be not only to utter the words with the mouth, but alſo to embrace, and firmly to hold in the mind, the meaning of them, who is thereof the more ſimple, who believes that tenet? For if any man would comprehend in mind, the meaning of that poſition, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that he diſtinguiſh between the divine eſſence and perſon. For unleſs he diſtinguiſh them, either he will believe, that there is in very deed only one divine Perſon, as one Eſſence, or hold three Eſſences, and ſo three Gods, no leſs than three divine Perſons: either of which deprives a man of Salvation, according to the Opinion of the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. But how many are there, who know how to diſtinguiſh a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſon from the Eſſence, and ſo may conceive three Perſons, that he may not imagine to himſelf together three Subſtances ſubſiſting by themſelves? Verily he muſt be a ſubtile man, and hold a marvellous opinion of a Perſon, who doth otherwiſe. What then ſhall become of the ruder men, for whom alike Chriſt dyed? But let us grant, that the ruder may perceive that tenet, will there not be need of a clear, frequent and diligent explication of that t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing to them? But where ſhall we chiefly ſeek an explication of ſo abſtruſe a thing? is it not in the holy Scriptures? Therefore if the perſpicuous explication
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:64944:132"/> of this thing be not ſo much as once indeed contained in them, it is to be concluded, that that doctrine is falſe, and cannot be deduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, no not by good conſequence, from the holy Scripture. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe not therefore lawful conſequences, which we alſo our ſelves wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly uſe: but in ſuch a doctrine as that is, of which we diſpute, we rightly hold, that there are no lawful conſequences, unleſs together a perſpicuous and open explication thereof could be held forth.</p>
                  <p>Others ſay, that not only this Doctrine may be drawn by lawful conſequences from the holy Scriptures, but alſo that it is really contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them. For though the word Trinity be not extant in them, yet the meaning of it is extant. But neither do we require, that they ſhew the very name of the Trinity, but the thing and meaning which they commonly comprehend in that name, clearly and perſpicuouſly expreſſed. That, I ſay, we require, that they ſhew where it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that God is One in Eſſence, Three in Perſons, the Father to be God, the Son to be God, to wit, moſt high, the holy Spirit to be God, and yet there are not three Gods, but thoſe three are one God. So the Father to be eternal, likewiſe the Son and holy Spirit, and yet theſe are not three eternals, but one eternal. We require theſe, or the like to them, the meaning of which may be manifeſt to all men, ſuch as are thoſe of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> with which at this day all the Temples do ring. but when they bring forth ſuch places, in which there is need of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that it may be made manifeſt, that this is the meaning of them, which they would have; they ſhall perform no more than thoſe, who would have ſo great a thing drawn out of holy Scriptures by conſequences only. See their two Achilles, or chief Champions,<note n="*" place="margin">

Are there three perſons in one Eſſence of God? We ſee three things; we ſee not three perſons: nor more one Eſſence of thoſe three; yea, rather we ſee divers Eſſences, and thoſe between themſelves unequal. Here cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is need of conſequences. Again,<note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7.</note> 
                     <hi>There are three, who give teſtimony in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Spirit: and theſe three are one.</hi> I repeat not now that which we ſhewed<note n="‖" place="margin">Cap. <hi>3.</hi> of this Section.</note> before, how ſuſpected this place is. Let us grant it to be undoubted. Whence is it manifeſt, that here is underſtood the Unity of Eſſence? They are one: are they therefore one in Eſſence? Not only the meaning it ſelf is not extant, but neither indeed can it be evinced by lawful conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. To be One, is a general word, and contains more ſpecies under it ſelf: One in eſſence, One in conſent, either of mind or teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, or of ſome other thing. But the genus being propoſed, ſome ſpecies is indeed propoſed, but not forthwith a determinate One; as in this place One in Eſſence. And indeed it were eaſier from this place, to ſhew, that there are diverſe Eſſences of thoſe three, than one, yea, it is impoſſible to ſhew this, Beſides, in which words is it ſaid, that the holy Spirit is a perſon? They muſt of neceſſity fly to conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>Now by the things ſaid, it appears, how injuriouſly they deal, who,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:64944:132"/> when Arguments from Reaſon are brought againſt that Doctrine, cry, that this is a myſtery, which is to be believed, not ſearched into; that Reaſon cannot comprehend theſe things; that we muſt reſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply upon the holy Scriptures. We ſhould yield to thoſe men, if they would prove that Doctrine by perſpicuous teſtimonies of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and not rather aſſert it againſt open and clear teſtimonies of them. But now when they cannot produce ſuch places, they do in vain affright us with the name of a myſtery, that we might not here uſe our reaſon, and ſo endeavour, as with a Gorgons head ſet before us, to turn us into ſtones. Although the tryal of Reaſon were not indeed, no not then, to be declined, if it were manifeſt that Myſtery to have been revealed from God. For what Myſtery will they produce out of holy Scriptures, which is repugnant to Reaſon? Myſteries indeed exceed Reaſon, but do not overthrow it, they do not extinguiſh the light of it, but perfect it: yea, Reaſon alone both perceiveth, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth, and defends the Myſteries revealed to it, which it could not of it ſelf find out. <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth Reaſon, when he proves the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 12, &amp;c.</note> which Myſtery even moſt of all exceeds Reaſon. Further add, that the Adverſaries themſelves do that ill, which they forbid us to do well. I will not now rehearſe it, that they cannot diſcourſe of the difference of eſſence and perſon, without the help of Reaſon. For where are thoſe things written in the holy Scriptures? And though they were written, they could not be perceived, nor explained without Reaſon. I now urge that, that all uſe conſequences, when they diſpute of this Doctrine, which they call a Myſtery. What then? doth not he uſe Reaſon, who uſeth Conſequences? Are perhaps all thoſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations written in the holy Scriptures? You will ſay, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the Arguments are written. Firſt, Let it be ſo. But the form it ſelf of Argumentation is not there delivered; neither is it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this which you uſe, is lawful, that which the Adverſaries uſe, is unlawful. What then doth ſhew it? Reaſon. But moreover, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve your Argumentations, and thoſe of yours, whom you moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and approve, how few Argumentations will you find, which are manifeſt from the holy Scriptures? What is more uſual than ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentations as theſe? To whom the Properties of that One God agree, he is that one God: But to Chriſt or the holy Spirit theſe agree. Again, To whom actions proper to perſons agree, he is a perſon: But they agree to the holy Spirit. But where are thoſe Propoſitions, which they call major Propoſitions (that I ſay nothing now of Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) written? whence will they draw them but from reaſon? But if Argumentation, when we treat even of Myſteries, may be firm from one Propoſition, which Reaſon only ſupplies, why may it not be alſo from two; if as well Reaſon approves both as one? Beſides, if we argue either from the Opinions of the Adverſaries themſelves, or from Opinions and Principles confeſſed by all, who can reprehend it, unleſs moſt unjuſtly? eſpecially if we ſhew that that Doctrine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, as they ſpeak, a contradiction, and overthrows it ſelf. For all men, who are of right underſtanding, do confeſs, that no doctrine can
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:64944:133"/> be true, which implies a contradiction, or the force of which is ſuch, that it is neceſſary, that the ſame thing be, and not be together, to wit, in the ſame reſpect, part, time. For this principle being taken away, all Science is taken away; and, although you ſhould a thouſand times demonſtrate God to be three in perſons, yet it might be allowed for another alike truely to ſay, that he is not three, and ſo in all other things. But we may, without difficulty, ſhew, that the common Doctrine of the Trinity of Perſons in one numerical Eſſence, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a contradiction. What then remains, but that it be acknowledged by all to be falſe? But that the thing is ſo as we have ſaid, being hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by Divine Aid, we ſhall demonſtrate in the following Book.</p>

                  <p>THat we may therfore perform that which we have propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the firſt place; firſt, Thence it is manifeſt, that the common Doctrine of three Perſons in one God, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a contradiction, and ſo overthroweth it ſelf, becauſe both one God, and three Gods, to wit, Moſt High, are there aſſerted together: One God indeed expreſly; but three, if you conſider the force of the Opinion. For they ſay, That there are three Perſons really diſtinct from among themſelves, each of which is God: For as much as they are wont to ſay, and are compelled to ſay by the force of their Opinion, <hi>The Father, is God, The Son is God, The holy Spirit is God,</hi> but they alwayes ſpeak of the ſame Moſt high God. But now where there are three perſons, really diſtinct from among themſelves, each of which is the moſt high God, there are three moſt high Gods. Reckon up now thoſe Perſons, and you will have three moſt high Gods; for the firſt will be the Father, the ſecond the Son, the third the holy Spirit. The matter needs no diſputation with him, who by reaſon of a preconceived Opinion concerning God, when there it is treated of him, hath not forgat to number three.</p>

                     <p>BUt nevertheleſs, they urge, that thoſe three are one God. If they ſhould ſo call thoſe three one God, as we call three or more Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators one Senate, ſince it cannot be ſaid of them ſeparately, thus far it might be pardoned to them. But ſeeing they pronounce the name of the moſt high God, of each perſon diſtinctly taken, and are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compelled to pronounce it by the force of their Opinion, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay it. For from this Opinion it doth altogether follow, that either the Father is the Son and holy Spirit; and reciprocally, or the Father is one God in number, another the Son, another the holy Spirit: the former of which takes away the real diſtinction of the perſons; the latter overthrows the Unity of God, and manifeſtly makes three Gods in number. For as to the former, thus I will argue, <hi>That one God is the Father,</hi> as the holy Scriptures teſtifie it, and the Adverſaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it. <hi>But the Son,</hi> according to the Adverſaries Opinion, <hi>is that one God, that ſame even in number, who was now called the Father; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son is the Father.</hi> But the ſame Argumentation may be alſo inverted, the premiſes being converted and tranſpoſed, and in like manner may be framed concerning the holy Spirit, in relation to the Father and Son. Nor can it otherwiſe be diſſolved, unleſs you ſay that the Son is one God in number, the Father another, likewiſe the holy Spirit another, and ſo there are three Gods in number. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whitherſoever the Adverſaries turn themſelves, by that their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, they overthrow both their own Doctrine, and the ſence of the holy Scriptures. Moreover, do I not rightly argue thus; The Father is a divine Perſon, the Son is a divine Perſon, the holy Spirit is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſon; therefore there are three divine Perſons, not one? The Adverſaries will altogether ſo aſſert. Why then do I not likewiſe rightly argue, The Father is the moſt high God, the Son is the moſt high God, the holy Spirit is the moſt high God; therefore there are three moſt high Gods, not one? If we would urge examples fetcht from things created; <hi>Peter</hi> is a man, <hi>Paul</hi> is a man, <hi>John</hi> is a man, therefore there are three men, not one: or <hi>Michael</hi> is an Angel, <hi>Gabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> is an Angel, <hi>Raphael</hi> is an Angel; therefore there are three Angels, not one: if, I ſay, we would urge theſe examples, the Adverſaries would cry out, that the thing is one way in creatures, another way in God. But now, when we uſe the example of divine Perſons, what will they ſay? That the thing is one way in divine Perſons, another way in God? Is it ſo? But what if we demonſtrate, that that very God, of whom we treat, is a divine Perſon, as alſo on the contrary? Will they yet deny that that is in force in God, which is in force in a divine Perſon? But it is eaſie to demonſtrate that, partly from the holy Scriptures, partly from the Opinion of the Adverſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:64944:135"/> They ſay, that each divine Perſon is that one God, and why may they not ſay it? Foraſmuch as they hold, that each of them hath the whole Eſſence of the one God; neither can they ſay otherwiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out overthrowing that Doctrine of the Trinity. Now the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures plainly affirm of the Father, that he is that one God. But that will be falſe, if that one God be not a divine Perſon. For it may be rightly argued thus; That One God is not a divine Perſon, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a divine Perſon; therefore the Father is not that one God. The ſame arguing according to the Adverſaries Opinion, will be found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Son and holy Spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Theſe things which are ſaid of us to confirm the firſt Argument, might alſo by themſelves be alleaged to refel the Adverſaries Opinion. But it matters not on our behalf, whether they be taken for peculiar Arguments, or for props of the firſt. Although this may be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med alſo by another general reaſon, for, <hi>whereſoever ſubjects are in very deed multiplyed, thoſe things alſo are multiplyed, which are ſaid di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly of each: and are indeed multiplyed according to the number of their ſubjects.</hi> We have already declared the thing by examples, both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and angelical, and humane: neither can it at all be refelled by any example. Run over all kinds of things, and you will find that the thing is ſo. As many men as there are, ſo many living creatures, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſubſtances are there; as many Angels, ſo many Spirits; as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lines, ſo many Longitudes and Quantities; as many Vertues, ſo many Habits, ſo many Qualities; as many Fathers, ſo many Relates; and ſo in the reſt. To wit, becauſe all thoſe Predicates are multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the number of their Subjects. Wherefore alſo as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny divine Perſons as there are, ſo many Gods, and indeed moſt high Gods, there will be, ſeeing the moſt high God is diſtinctly predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of each divine perſon. Whence it appeareth, that the Athanaſian Creed, doth plainly contradict it ſelf, while it thus pronounceth, <hi>The Father is God, The Son is God, The holy Spirit is God; and yet there are not three Gods, but one God.</hi> And alſo, the Father is Eternal, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Infinite; in the ſame manner both the Son and holy Spirit: and yet there are not three Eternals, Omnipotents, Infinits; but on Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Omnipotent, Infinite.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps ſome one will ſay, that the word <hi>God</hi> is one way taken when it is predicated of each perſon; another way when it is put abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: there it is taken hypoſtatically, or perſonally; here eſſentially. Truly I do not believe, that the more accute Adverſaries will ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſince they will have God, as alſo ſome the Father, eſſentially taken, to be predicated alſo of each of the perſons. Add hereunto, that it would be neceſſary to make the ſame Ambiguity in the word <hi>Eternal, Omnipotent, Infinite,</hi> that one ſhould be ſaid to be eſſentially eternal, omnipotent, infinite, not perſonally: another on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſonally. Otherwiſe they ſhould again labour to reconcile that contradiction which may ſeem to be in thoſe words, that ſince the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is both eternal, and omnipotent, and infinite, and likewiſe the Son and the holy Spirit; and yet there are not three eternals, omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:64944:135"/> infinites, but one only. But I remember not that I have ever read, or heard, that the Adverſaries do feign the ſame ambiguity in the word <hi>Eternal, Omnipotent, Infinite.</hi> Wherefore I do not eaſily believe, as I ſaid, that the more acute Adverſaries will ſo anſwer. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, if any ſhall ſo anſwer, what other thing will he ſay, than that the Athanaſian Creed playes ſophiſtically, and deceives rude and ſimple men with the ambiguity of a word? For who of them would think, that the word <hi>God</hi> is there taken two manner of wayes. For to what purpoſe, I pray you, are thoſe words added, <hi>And yet there are not three Gods, but one God?</hi> Is it not for that cauſe, leſt any, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the ruder ſort of men, hearing the Father to be God, the Son to be God, the holy Spirit to be God, ſhould thence gather, that there are three Gods? But in what ſignification? ſurely in that in which he had heard, that the Father is God, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe both the Son and the holy Spirit. For this ſcruple doth firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, neither preſently the other ſignification of the word comes into the mind of a rude man. This opinion therefore is refuted by thoſe words; and further, the word <hi>God</hi> is taken in the ſame manner in both places, not one way then when it is ſpoken of each of the perſons, and another way then when it is put abſolutely, and God is ſaid to be one. Beſides, from ſuch an exception it follows nevertheleſs, that it may be rightly ſaid, that there are three Gods, if the word <hi>God</hi> be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken perſonally, as indeed the Adverſaries confeſs it is often ſo taken in the holy Scriptures. And it might indeed ſeem ſtrange, that they do not expreſly ſay, that there are three Gods, but that they ſee, that it is moſt openly repugnant to the holy Scriptures: whileſt they are bold to ſay, that there are three <hi>Elohim;</hi> and ſome Books are extant <hi>concerning three Elohim,</hi> written by divers Adverſaries. For what other thing doth <hi>Elohim</hi> ſignifie, than <hi>Gods?</hi> Therefore three <hi>Elohim</hi> are three <hi>Gods;</hi> namely, they endeavour by an Hebrew, and leſs known word ſomewhat, but ridiculouſly, to cover the abſurdity. Indeed ſuch manner of ſpeaking is reprehended by ſome more accute Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; of the number of whom yet there are not wanting, who judge the Hebrew <hi>Elohim,</hi> when it is pronounced of the moſt high God, to be plural, no leſs in ſignification than Grammatical form. But if it be plural in ſignification alſo, it ſignifies Gods, no leſs than the Greek <hi>Theoi,</hi> or other words anſwering to it in other languages. Therefore there are more Gods. But moreover, the diſtinction between God hypoſtatically or perſonally and eſſentially taken, is altogether vain, eſpecially when it is ſpoken concerning the moſt high God. For both the very word <hi>God,</hi> is the name of a perſon, ſince it is the name chiefly of him that hath command over others; and the moſt high God ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the ſupream Ruler and Monarch of all things. But to command and rule belongs only to perſons. Add, that we have ſhewed above in this very chapter, that that one God, beſides whom there is no other, is a perſon; as on the contrary, there cannot be any one hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatically or perſonally God, I ſay, the moſt high God, but he is alſo eſſentially ſo. For is not he eſſentially God, who hath the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:64944:136"/> Eſſence? But whoſoever is hypoſtatically the moſt high God, he hath the divine Eſſence. But if you will ſay that God taken eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſignifies the Eſſence it ſelf, which is neither Father, nor Son, nor holy Spirit, or contrarily, but ſomething ſubſiſting in thoſe three: Firſt, I ſhall not eaſily believe that the Adverſaries, who ſpeak more accurately, will admit that, ſince the eſſence, eſpecially ſo taken, as that it cannot be predicated of each of the divine perſons, ſignifies ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing abſtract. But <hi>God</hi> is concrete, ſuch indeed as is found in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and denotes an Eſſence, together with an Exiſtence or Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence. But further, whatever at laſt the Adverſaries will determine of this matter, we have already ſhewn, that the name of God is the name of a perſon; and ſince it is certain, that the name of one God is ſo uſed in the holy Scriptures, that it is directly predicated of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but the Adverſaries would have it ſo, that it ſhould be predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated alſo of the Son, and the holy Spirit; it will be neceſſary to ſhew, where the word <hi>God,</hi> when there it is ſpoken of that one God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes ſome ſuch thing, as neither is Father, nor Son, nor holy Spirit. Laſtly, Such a ſignification will make nothing to the matter. For we diſpute of that God of whom the Adverſaries ſpeak, when they ſay, that the Father is God, the Son is God, the holy Spirit is God: and not of that God, who cannot after that manner be predicated of the divine perſons. And thus much concerning the firſt Argument.</p>

                  <p>ANother Reaſon by which it is ſhewed, that the common Doctrine of the Trinity doth overthrow it ſelf, is, that thence it follows, that each perſon of the Deity is three in perſons, and ſo it is both one, and not one together.

                  <argument>
                     <p>The third Argument. Becauſe the divine Perſons would in very deed be the ſame, and diverſe.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe third Argument is, That the Adverſaries maintain, that the Eſſence is in very deed the ſame with the Perſons, and that the Perſons do really differ from among themſelves. For hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the ſame thing is at once both one thing, and more than one; differ really from it ſelf, and not differ. For thoſe things which are the ſame really with ſome one thing, are really the ſame among themſelves alſo. But the three divine Perſons, really diſtinct among themſelves, are really the ſame with ſome one thing, namely, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence. Therefore the three perſons really diſtinct among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are really the ſame among themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The Concluſion doth manifeſtly contradict it ſelf. The Propoſition which they call the Major, reſts on a Principle known to all, which they do commonly thus expreſs. Thoſe things which are the ſame with one third thing (that is, with ſomething wherewith they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred) are alſo among themſelves the ſame. And there is the ſame force of the <hi>Axiome,</hi> if you add both in the predicate, and in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of that enunciation, the word <hi>Really.</hi> For thoſe things which are really the ſame with one third, are one and the ſame thing with the third. For what other thing is it to be the ſame things really, than to be one and the ſame thing? But thoſe things which are one and the ſame with one third, it is neceſſary that they be the ſame thing alſo among themſelves: otherwiſe that third thing, with which thoſe things are the ſame thing, ſhould at once be both one thing, and more things. So ſome of the Adverſaries themſelves are wont to prove, that the divine Attributes are not really diſtinguiſhed among themſelves. The divine Attributes, ſay they, are really the ſame thing with the divine Eſſence.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:64944:137"/> Therefore they are really the ſame thing among themſelves. Becauſe thoſe things which are really the ſame with one third, <label type="milestone">

                     </note> who ſee that their Opinion concerning the Trinity, is by this means everted, ſay, that this Reaſon is not firm, and that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Axiome, Thoſe things which are the ſame with one third, are the ſame among themſelves;</hi> ought thus to be underſtood, <hi>Thoſe things which are the ſame with one third thing incommunicable, are the ſame among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> But it is manifeſt, that the divine Eſſence is not incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, ſince it is the ſame in number in the three Perſons really diſtinct among themſelves. Neither indeed can the Adverſaries bring any other inſtance, by which they may invalid that <hi>Axiome,</hi> beſides that thing, of which is here the controverſie, and is refelled by this very Reaſon. But that Major, propoſed both by us and others, admits no inſtance or exception: becauſe the reaſon of it is altogether univerſal. For unleſs it be admitted, a plain contradiction follows, as we have ſeen; to wit, that one and the ſame thing, is at once both the ſame thing, and more things. Wherefore if ſomething be feigned commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable, which is the ſame thing really with three things really diſtinct among themſelves; as here the divine Eſſence which is one thing with the three Perſons, that ſhall at once be both one thing, and more than one. Therefore ſuch a communicable thing is not to be admited; &amp; if it be brought for an inſtance to invalid that <hi>Axiome</hi> in this our controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, this will be a mere begging of that which ought to be proved, ſince that communicable thing by this very reaſon may be refelled. But it eaſily appeareth to any one, that ſuch a communicable thing imply a contradiction, if you conſider what may be here underſtood by that word. For here they call that thing Communicable, which when it is one in number, yet may be common to more in number. For ſo they would have the divine Eſſence to be communicable. For as much as they acknowledge together with us, that it is one in number, but will have it common to three perſons in number, ſo that it may be diſtinctly predicated <hi>in concrete</hi> of each of them; namely, in this manner, The Father is God, the Son is God, the holy Spirit is God, and yet they would have thoſe three to be one God. For what other thing is this, than that one thing in number, is more things in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; that it is <hi>individuum,</hi> and not <hi>individuum?</hi> For it is <hi>individuum</hi> becauſe it is one in number, not <hi>individuum,</hi> becauſe it may be ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into more things of the ſame name, that yet the whole may be in each of them, which thing is altogether repugnant to the Reaſon of <hi>individuum.</hi> Therefore that Reaſon which we have propounded, is firm: which, if it pleaſe you, you may alſo ſo propound, that it may be concluded, that the divine Eſſence ſhall be at once both one only thing, and more than one. For all confeſs indeed that it is one: but it follows from their tenet, that it is more than one; becauſe they maintain it, to be really the ſame thing with three perſons really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct among themſelves. For if thoſe three Perſons are really diſtinct among themſelves, it is neceſſary that they are three diſtinct things.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:64944:137"/> For the ſame thing really, is that, which is one thing; really diſtinct, which are more things: which both the thing it ſelf ſhews, and the chief of the Adverſaries confeſs: and they who deny it, know not what they ſay. For they are neceſſitated to maintain the ſame thing to differ really from it ſelf, which overthrows it ſelf. Now if the Eſſence be really the ſame thing with three perſons really diſtinct among themſelves; it is neceſſary, that it be the ſame thing with three diſtinct things. But that which is the ſame thing with three diſtinct things, it is neceſſary, that it ſhould be three things. Wherefore the divine Eſſence, ſhall be together both one thing, and three things; which, as we have ſaid, is repugnant to it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Let us add a Corollary to this Argument, that the divine Perſons will be together one of themſelves, and one only by Accident: and ſo one of themſelves, and not of themſelves; by accident, and not by accident. For thoſe things which are one in reſpect of Eſſence, and that indeed the ſame in number, are chiefly one of themſelves. Greater Unity cannot indeed be imagined among thoſe things, which are conceived like diverſe things. And in that manner are the divine Perſons maintained to be one thing. But again, thoſe things which are actually, and in the ultimate perfection two or more, are not one of themſelves, but one only by accident. For thoſe things which are of themſelves one thing, are ſuch, and ſo fitted together, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one of them doth ſo reſpect the other, as <hi>Potentia</hi> doth its <hi>Actus,</hi> or as the thing to be perfected, doth ſome further perfection; or may be perfected together by ſome other <hi>Actus,</hi> in as much as yet it hath not in it ſelf its ultimate perfection. For it is the <hi>Actus</hi> which both conjoyns and ſeparates. It conjoyns, if one; it diſ-joyns, if more than one. But the divine Perſons, are neither ſo referred to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves mutually, nor to ſome other thing; as <hi>potentia</hi> to <hi>actus,</hi> and further perfection, having already attained their utmoſt perfection. The Eſſence cannot be ſuch <hi>actus.</hi> For the perſons rather add to the Eſſence ſomething of perfection; to wit, ſubſiſtence, and perſonal propriety, than on the contrary; and that ſubſiſtence preſuppoſeth the Eſſence, not on the contrary.</p>

                  <p>FOurthly, By this reaſon alſo a contradiction may be ſhewed in that tenet, becauſe it introduceth together both one and more Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of God. All maintain that there is one Subſtance of one God. But the plurality of perſons neceſſarily requires more. For if a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be no other thing than an ultimate intelligent Subſtance; where there are more perſons, it is neceſſary that there be more ultimate intelligent ſubſtances. For the <hi>Definitum,</hi> or the thing defined, being multiplyed, which is here a perſon, the whole definition is alſo mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed, or that whole which is expreſſed in the definition. For the <hi>Definitum,</hi> or the thing defined, and the definition, or that which is expreſt in the definition, are really one and the ſame thing, and differ only in the manner of explaining. You may alſo propound the ſame Reaſon more briefly, thus; If each Perſon be a Subſtance, where there are more perſons, there alſo are more ſubſtances. For <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals</hi> being multiplyed, that alſo which obtains the place of a genus, as well as that which obtains the place of a ſpecies, is multiplied in the ſame <hi>individuals.</hi> Becauſe individuals are nothing elſe than that which is expreſſed by the name of the ſpecies and genus, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by differences, which they call <hi>individuating differences.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unleſs that which hath the place of the ſpecies and genus, ſo, as we have ſaid, contracted, be multiplyed, individuals are not multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now perſons are individuals, whoſe <hi>genus</hi> is <hi>ſubſtance.</hi> But that every Perſon is a Subſtance, and that a Subſtance is predicated of a Perſon, as a Superiour on its Inferiour, is firſt manifeſt by induction. For both a humane and Angelical, and divine Perſon is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.

Will you perhaps de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Father and the Son to be <hi>Subſtances?</hi> For there are certain ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious men, who dare not uſe the word <hi>Subſtance</hi> concerning God: becauſe it belongs to a Subſtance to be ſubject to Accidents: but is an heinous offence with them to ſay, that there are Accidents in God. And yet the ſame do not reprehend their own men, who ſay, that there is one Subſtance of God; and that which is ſung for many Ages in Temples, <hi>The Father, Son, holy Spirit are three names,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64944:138"/> all the ſame ſubſtance.</hi> But let us free them from this fear. To be <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> to Accidents, <hi>that</hi> is an Accident to a Subſtance. To ſubſiſt by it ſelf, <hi>this</hi> is to be a Subſtance. But do not the Father and the Son ſubſiſt by themſelves? If they ſubſiſt not by themſelves, nothing will ſubſiſt by it ſelf. Will you, who do fear to aſcribe any Accident to God, perhaps make God himſelf an Accident? But whatſoever is nor a Subſtance, is an Accident. I omit that no man can deny the Son to be a Subſtance, but he who dares to deny him to be a man. But it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the Adverſaries ſay the ſame of the holy Spirit, which is ſaid of the Father and Son.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe ſome, although otherwiſe they ſay,<note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that God is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, yet deny the divine Perſons to be Subſtances, as afterwards will more clearly appear. Let us prove the ſame thing alſo by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon, that being aſſumed, which is generally put out of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie by all the Adverſaries. They all, being taught by the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, do maintain that a perſon is nothing elſe but an <hi>intelligent Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum.</hi> That <hi>Suppoſitum</hi> is the <hi>Genus</hi> of a Perſon; <hi>Intelligent,</hi> the ſpecifical difference of it; which being added to that <hi>Genus,</hi> doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the whole definition of a perſon. And that word <hi>Suppoſitum,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in this ſignification barbarous, is very uſual in Schools, when they ſpeak of the divine Perſons. For they ſay that there are three <hi>Suppoſitums</hi> in God. But now a <hi>Suppoſitum,</hi> as it is explained by the Schoolmen themſelves, the authors of that word ſo uſed, is<note n="*" place="margin">Prima ſabſtantia completa.</note> 
                     <hi>a firſt or individual Subſtance compleat:</hi> they are wont to add, that it is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable, although without neceſſity; as we ſhall hear preſently. They call it a <hi>Subſtance,</hi> that they may exclude <hi>Accidents;</hi> a <hi>firſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> that they may exclude the univerſal, to wit, <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species;</hi> a <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>perfect Subſtance,</hi> that they may exclude the parts of the ſubſtances, whether integral or eſſential. Laſtly, they ſay, that it is <hi>incommunicable,</hi> that it may not be common to more <hi>Suppoſitums,</hi> nor be conjoyned with another <hi>Suppoſitum.</hi> Which condition they have add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſake, partly of the divine eſſence, partly of the human nature of Chriſt; to both which, all other conditions of a <hi>Suppoſitum</hi> do agree. Therefore except they added this condition, they ſaw it would follow, that both the one and the other would be a <hi>Suppoſitum,</hi> and ſince it is endued with underſtanding, alſo a Perſon. Wherefore, leſt thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the doctrine concerning three Perſons in one Eſſence of God, here the tenet concerning the hypoſtatical or perſonal union of two natures in Chriſt, ſhould fall to the ground (for there cannot be more perſons in one perſon) they have this prop of <hi>incommunicability</hi> put to it. But that condition, as far as it hinders the Subſtance to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to many Suppoſitums, is contained in the name of the <hi>firſt</hi> or ſingular Subſtance. For it would not be <hi>ſingular,</hi> if it were common to many ſingulars; as we have above <hi>(chap.</hi> 3. <hi>of this Section</hi>) ſhewn. But as far as it hinders, leſt it may be conjoyned with another Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum, and ſo cohere with it, that it may be partaker of its ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence; it is comprehended in the word <hi>Compleat.</hi> For now it would not be compleat, but it would be the part of another, if it would in
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:64944:139"/> the manner be conjoyned with another Suppoſitum. Of which thing we ſhall ſpeak elſewhere (<hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 6, <hi>and</hi> 8. <hi>of this Book.</hi>) In this place we have need of this thing. For neither the force of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which we now urge, is therein placed; but in this, that very Suppoſitum is a Subſtance. That as yet ſeems to be added; as we may more rightly perceive the reaſon of this deſcription, that the Schoolmen have therefore called ſuch a Subſtance, as I now have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, a <hi>Suppoſitum,</hi> becauſe that at laſt may deſerve to be called a <hi>Suppoſitum;</hi> which is, as it were, put under and ſubjected to all other predications, or things, which may be predicated of ſome other thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Briefly, that which is the <hi>ultimum ſubjectum,</hi> of which other things are predicated, and it ſelf of no other. But this is no other thing but a firſt and ſingular Subſtance. For this is predicated of no other thing, becauſe neither hath it any thing inferiour to it ſelf, nor any <hi>ſubjectum,</hi> in which it may be inherent like an accident: but it is the <hi>ultimum ſubjectum,</hi> which both the ſecond Subſtances; to wit, the <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi> and Accidents of, are predicated.</p>
                  <p>Concerning which thing, the <hi>Catagories,</hi> which are inſcribed <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi> may be ſeen. Of thoſe alſo ſpeak the vulgar <hi>Axiome, Actions are of Suppoſitums;</hi> becauſe Actions do moſt properly agree to the firſt, and that indeed perfect or compleat Subſtances. If therefore <hi>every Perſon be a Suppoſitum, and every Suppoſitum a Subſtance, every perſon alſo muſt be a ſubſtance:</hi> and further, where there are <hi>more Perſons, it is neceſſary, that there be alſo more Subſtances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not a few of the Adverſaries have ſeen the force of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore that they might avoid it, they have perverted the true definition of a perſon, commonly received alſo in Schools, if you conſider the thing it ſelf. For they ſay that a Perſon is not a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> or thing by it ſelf ſubſiſting, bu an incommunicable <hi>ſubſiſtence,</hi> of an intelligent nature. This, they ſay, is the accurate definition of a perſon: but that by which a perſon was defined in Schools; to wit, that it is an individual intelligent, incommunicable, that Subſtance not ſuſtained by another, is leſs accurate. For it agrees to a perſon <hi>in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creto,</hi> not <hi>in abſtracto:</hi> but the definition of <hi>Concretums,</hi> are not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but that of <hi>Abſtractums<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> But further, they ſay that the <hi>ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence,</hi> is a certain mode of a <hi>Being,</hi> not a <hi>Being</hi> it ſelf. For it being con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

Certainly this thing is of it ſelf moſt unworthy of God; yea, as we ſhall ſee by its force, takes away all Empire and Honour from the Fat er and Son, and doth in a manner lead men to Atheiſm.

                     </gap>t underſtanding. But what do I ſpeak only of the ſimple men? Indeed neither moſt of the learned do reſpect to themſelves ſuch perſons, either when they pray, or when they think any other thing of God, or of Chriſt; perhaps nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they themſelves, who have deviſed thoſe things, except then, when they labour to reconcile ſome of their tenets to one another.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things might ſufficiently, refute the device (to ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But yet that both the Nature of a perſon may ſo much the more clearly appear, and be ſo much the more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, let us ſay a little more of that matter. Firſt then, Whilſt they make a perſon a ſubſiſtence, they forget themſelves, who ſay the ſame is a <hi>Suppoſitum.</hi> Neither indeed could I hitherto ſee any man, who would deny that a <hi>Suppoſitum</hi> is the <hi>Genus</hi> of a Perſon, and that it may accurately <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e predicated of it. And this might be here enough for us, that all acknowledge in God three <hi>Suppoſitums.</hi> But now they ſay, that a <hi>Suppoſitum</hi> is ſuch a Subſtance as we have before deſcribed: and the reaſon of its name, which the inventers of it have looked or, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it. For neither is a ſubſiſtence the <hi>ultimum ſubjectum,</hi> or loweſt ſubject; of which ultimate, all things may at laſt be predicated, and it ſelf of none: but a Subſtance it ſelf, or a Being endued with ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence: ſubſiſtence is in a <hi>Being,</hi> and although it be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ot an Accident, yet is it predicated of that, in which it is in the manner of an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. But all ſuch things are denyed by all to be <hi>Suppoſitums.</hi> Add this, that the actions which are proper to <hi>Suppoſitums,</hi> agree not to a Subſiſtence, but to a Subſtance it ſelf, or a <hi>Being</hi> that hath ſubſiſtence, as that which hath a power neceſſary for acting: as we have a lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore minded. Subſiſtence doth contribute nothing leſs, but that a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> may ſubſiſt by it ſelf; and moreover, may act by it, if, namely, it hath a power and ſome faculties. Beſides, who would ſay that a man of an Angel is a ſubſiſtence, and not rather a ſubſtance, or thing by it ſelf ſubſiſting? But every man is a perſon, and in like manner every
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64944:140"/> Angel: And that we may go higher; Chriſt alſo is a ſubſtance, not a ſubſiſtence; a <hi>being,</hi> not a mode of a <hi>being.</hi> But he is a perſon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a perſon is not a ſubſiſtence. Otherwiſe from the Adverſaries opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion we ſhould thus argue. Every perſon is a ſubſiſtence: No Man, Angel, nor Chriſt himſelf is a ſubſiſtence. Wherefore neither a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps ſome one will ſay, that created perſons are indeed ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but the divine perſons are ſubſiſtences: neither is a perſon a <hi>genus univocum,</hi> to a perſon created and uncreated; but <hi>analogum</hi> only. But firſt, we may ask of him, whether he would have Chriſt to be a created perſon only, or uncreated, or both together? If created only, his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion will be falſe, as being one who maintains Chriſt to be the ſecond perſon of the Trinity. For this perſon is uncreated; nor could it ceaſe to be uncreated, but that the Trinity would fall to the ground, one perſon, to wit, the ſecond, being taken out of the number of the three. If uncreated only, Chriſt will be only a ſubſiſtence (if a divine perſon be a ſubſiſtence only, not a thing ſubſiſting) which all ſee to be falſe, For he who is a man, is certainly a ſubſtance, not a ſubſiſtence. If both together, he will have two perſons of a different nature, or of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent definition. For the one will be a ſubſtance, the other a ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, not a ſubſtance. But there is but one Chriſt, one perſon of him, as all confeſs and urge it againſt Neſtorians.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the reaſon or definition of a Suppoſitum, which agrees even to a divine or uncreated perſon, doth not permit, as we have ſeen, the divine perſon to be only a ſubſiſtence; I ſay, no more than a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Laſtly, that very thing which is brought for a reaſon, doth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw that Opinion. For if a perſon be an <hi>analogum genus</hi> to a perſon both uncreated and created, it muſt needs be that a divine perſon is not a ſubſiſtence, but a ſubſtance. For neither are <hi>analogums</hi> the ſubſiſtence of God, and the created thing ſubſiſting; but the ſubſtance created is <hi>analogum</hi> to the uncreated, the ſubſiſtence to the ſubſiſtence, the mode to the mode, and reciprocally. Wherefore if the perſon c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ence, I ſay, a thing ſubſiſting, not a mode of a thing.</p>
                  <p>But as for that which they ſay, that when a perſon is ſaid to be a <hi>firſt intelligent ſubſtance,</hi> this definition is of a perſon taken <hi>in concreto,</hi> not <hi>in abſtracto.</hi> I will ask of them what they underſtand by the name of a perſon taken <hi>in concreto,</hi> what likewiſe taken <hi>in abſtracto?</hi> If they do in that manner take the <hi>concretum,</hi> in which ſubſtance are ſaid of ſome to be <hi>concretums;</hi> as <hi>man, animal,</hi> whoſe <hi>abſtractums</hi> they will have to be <hi>humanity, animality;</hi> Of ſuch <hi>concretums,</hi> there are delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red moſt accurate definitions: and in this manner a perſon is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be defined in this place, where it is inquired whether the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and holy Spirit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Laſtly, although at length we ſhould grant the divine perſons to be ſubſiſtences, not ſubſtances; nevertheleſs, yet a contradiction would lye hid in the vulgar tenet of the Trinity.

                  <p>THe fifth Argument of this kind is, that if there be more perſons in one ſubſtance of God, it is neceſſary alſo, that there be more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtences in the ſame: as the Adverſaries do not only confeſs, but alſo urge, ſince <hi>ſubſiſtence</hi> is the form of a ſuppoſitum.

Wherefore neither can the <hi>Suppoſitums</hi> and <hi>Perſons</hi> be multiplyed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs alſo the <hi>Subſiſtences</hi> be multiplyed.

But it is impoſſible that there ſhould be more ſubſiſtences of one ſubſtance in number.

                  <p>Beſides, If there be more Subſiſtences in the ſame Subſtance, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that there be ſome diſtinction between them. For if there be no diſtinction, there will be one Subſiſtence, not more. But there is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between them. For the forms, whether of Subſtances, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, whether they be of modes or things, if they be of the ſame <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſpecialiſſima,</hi> cannot be diſtinguiſhed from among themſelves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be in divers <hi>ſubjectums</hi> or matters, or at leaſt in divers parts of

But here (that we may transfer this to our matter) neither are there diverſe <hi>Subjectums,</hi> but the ſame divine ſubſtance in number; the ſame time; nor divers parts; ſince neither the ſubſiſtence agrees but to the whole ſubſtance, nor the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence is compounded out of parts. Alſo divers reſpects here have no place, ſince ſubſiſtence is not a <hi>relatum.</hi> Therefore there will be found no diſtinction between thoſe ſubſiſtences, and conſequently between divine perſons. But the Adverſaries would have them, and the matter would require them to be diſtinct between themſelves, and that indeed really. It remains therefore that they are not of the ſame nature and definition, and conſequently, that they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in which they do agree; becauſe they all are both ſubſiſtences, exiſting in the divine Eſſence, and ſomething in which they do mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally differ, and are from among themſelves <hi>ſpecie,</hi> or in <hi>the ſpecies</hi> diſtinguiſhed. But neither do the Adverſaries, admit ſuch a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the genus and ſpecifical difference in the divine Perſons. And it is impoſſible, that thoſe things ſhould differ in that ſpecies and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, the eſſence of which is one in number. For thoſe things which differ in the ſpecies and definition, they do differ by this very thing alſo in the Eſſence: ſince the ſpecies pertains to the Eſſence, and the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a thing explains the Eſſence; which where it is altogether one, the definition alſo is in very deed one. Laſtly, that ſubſiſtence, of which it is here ſpoken, doth forthwith make the ſubſtance, in which it is incommunicable to more ſuppoſitums. Therefore where there is one ſubſiſtence, the reſt are thence forthwith excluded. For if there would be more ſubſiſtences, there would be more ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tums. Although here it is ſufficient for us to have ſhewed, that there are not more ſuppoſitums in the ſame ſubſtance. But that that ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence makes the ſubſtance, in which it is incommunicable, is manifeſt from this, that by reaſon of it the ſuppoſitum is incommunicable to more ſuppoſitums. And if the ſuppoſitum, alſo the ſubſtance, which by reaſon of that ſubſiſtence, becomes, and is conſtituted a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. For every form, that which it beſtows on the whole, beſtows al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo on the matter in which it is, or on that which anſwers to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and unleſs it would beſtow it, it ſhould not beſtow it, no not to the whole, which is conſtituted of it. For ſo far it makes the whole <hi>ſuch,</hi> as far as it makes the matter of the whole, which was ſuch <hi>in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia, ſuch in actu.</hi> There is the ſame reaſon of thoſe things, which by analogy anſwer to theſe. But here the form is the ſubſiſtence: the eſſence or ſubſtance (wherein the ſubſiſtence is, and with which it makes the ſuppoſitum, or rather, which for that reaſon that it hath, that ſubſiſtence is the ſuppoſitum it ſelf) anſwers to the matter. But if a body, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the ſixth place, that may be alleaged, that it follows from the common doctrine of the Trinity, that the divine Perſons are both incommunicable, and communicable, and ſo ſuppoſitums, and not ſuppoſitums; perſons, and not perſons. For it is manifeſt among all, that every ſuppoſitum, and further alſo, every perſon, ought to be incommunicable to another ſuppoſitum or perſon, whether one or more. Whence alſo in the definition of a perſon, they commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs <hi>incommunicability.</hi> But if the divine Eſſence, the ſame in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, be common, or, as they ſpeak, communicable to more ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tums, or divine perſons, the ſuppoſitums alſo themſelves, and thoſe perſons will be communicable to more ſuppoſitums and perſons. For thoſe things, the Eſſence of which, and that indeed the whole, is communicable to more ſuppoſitums, are themſelves communicable to more ſuppoſitums. For nothing can be more communicated to another (if ſo be that that be another thing, and not rather the ſame) than that whoſe whole, and the ſame eſſence in number is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to another: and univerſally, nothing can more agree to any thing, than that which agrees to it in reſpect of the Eſſence, and that the whole. Therefore if the whole Eſſence of the divine perſons be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to more ſuppoſitums, thoſe perſons themſelves will be communicable to more ſuppoſitums. Wherefore they will be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both communicable and incommunicable; and ſo ſuppoſitums, and not ſuppoſitums; perſons, and not perſons.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>VVE will make the laſt Argument of this kind, that which can be eaſily underſtood even by the moſt rude men: and concerning which, it is believed by the Adverſaries, that it is eaſie to be eluded; to wit, that we ſee in things created, that there is only one perſon, not more, of one intelligent ſubſtance; and that we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this thing further, that there cannot be more Suppoſitums, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there be alſo more Subſtances and Eſſences in number. Why then ſhould we not hold the ſame thing concerning God? We ſhall ſee by and by the reaſon of the conſequence, when we have examined the exception of the Adverſaries, by which they endeavour to ſubvert this Argument. For they ſay that there is a different conſideration of a ſubſtance created and uncreated: for that is finite, this infinite. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the finite indeed, if it be one in number, cannot ſubſiſt in more <hi>Suppoſitums</hi> or Perſons; but the infinite may. But this difference is of no moment in that matter whereof we treat. For then at length it might be of ſome moment, if a perſon uncreated ſhould not as well be infinite, as the Eſſence or Subſtance, in which it is believed to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; or a part of ſomething could be a Suppoſitum or Perſon. Now ſince the caſe is otherwiſe, here is the ſame reaſon or conſideration of a finite and infinite Perſon. For why cannot a finite Subſtance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute but one perſon? namely, becauſe a perſon or ſuppoſitum, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſeth the whole ſubſtance in it, not ſome part of it; neither can the ſame ſubſtance at the ſame time, according to the ſame thing, be twice the ſame; and conſequently, neither be twice a ſuppoſitum, twice a perſon. But there is the ſame reaſon alſo in a divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſince each divine Perſon comprehends the whole divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, neither doth or can take to it ſelf only ſome part of it, unleſs it ceaſe to be a ſuppoſitum or perſon.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore an infinite Subſtance, can no more have more Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tums or Perſons in it ſelf, than a finite. To which it is added, that if by reaſon of the difference of the finite and infinite, there ſhould be alſo difference in the number of <hi>Suppoſitums,</hi> it would follow that this difference in reſpect of number, ſhould be infinite. For the infinite diſtance, which is between a finite and infinite Subſtance, and which is thought to bring forth that difference of the number of perſons, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires this. Therefore the Perſons in the infinite Subſtance of God, ſhould be held to be infinite in number alſo, not finite, and that three
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:64944:143"/> only. For between three things, and one, is not only a finite, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a very little difference.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, that this reaſon doth not evince, that there are in God, infinite, or innumerable perſons, but that there may be, or that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinders, but that there may be; becauſe the infiniteneſs of his Eſſence may permit it. But beſides, that the Adverſaries ſay, that <hi>Eſſe</hi> and <hi>Poſſe</hi> are the ſame in God, this is certain, that whatever things may be naturally in God, and do not depend on his free will, they are in very deed alſo, and neceſſarily in him. For it is neceſſary, that they con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>n in them ſome perfection, and that a natural one. But no natural perfection, which can agree to God, can be abſent from him, ſince he cannot be of an imperfect nature, or ſuch, as to whom any thing of perfection may be yet added.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THat therefore we may come to that former Doctrine; the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries affirm, and, unleſs they would affirm it, they could not defend the Doctrine of the Trinity, that the Son was ſo begotten from eternity out of the Eſſence of the Father, that nevertheleſs, he hath the ſame Eſſence in number with the Father. But that doctrine is full of many contradictions, and abſurdities. For firſt, it follows thence, that the Son is the Son and Father of himſelf. For out of whoſe Eſſence any one is generated, he is his Son. But if that opinion of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, concerning the Son of God, be true, it follows that the Son is begotten out of his own Eſſence, wherefore the Son ſhall be his own Son; and moreover, the Father of himſelf: which thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a manifeſt contradiction. There is no need to demonſtrate the Propoſition of the Argument, which they call the Major, ſeeing the thing is manifeſt even with the Adverſaries. But the Aſſumption or Minor is thence manifeſt, becauſe if the Eſſence of the Father and Son be the ſame in number; certainly if the Son be begotten out of the Eſſence of the Father, he is b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gotten out of his own Eſſence. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed can they ſay, that that Eſſence was not yet the Eſſence of the Son, becauſe they hold there was no time, in which the Son was not exiſtent, and had not the divine Eſſence, otherwiſe he ſhould not be the moſt high God. You may alſo in this manner propound the ſame Argument. None is generated of himſelf; for then he ſhould be before he is; he ſhould be ſo, becauſe he ſhould be the principle and cauſe of his own generation: he ſhould not be ſo, becauſe he ſhould be generated. That of which any thing is generated, and that which is generated of it, are relatives. But relatives cannot be in the ſame thing, in the ſame reſpect, and at the ſame time; for they are oppoſites. But the nature of oppoſites is ſuch, that they mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſtroy one another, in the ſame ſubject, at the ſame time and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, according to the ſame thing, or the ſame part. But now if the Son be begotten out of the Eſſence of the Father, and the Eſſence of the Father and Son be the ſame in number, the Son is begotten of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe he is begotten alſo out of his own Eſſence. But none can more properly be begotten of any one, than when he is begotten out of his Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>The ſame abſurdity is manifeſt alſo from the manner in which the antient Fathers, partly the Architects, partly the Patrons of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:64944:144"/> opinion concerning, the Trinity, have affirmed that the Son of God is generated from eternity; which alſo at this day very many acknowledge: ſince they cannot deviſe another manner by any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon agreeable to their opinion. For they ſay, <hi>The Father hath begotten the Son by underſtanding himſelf:</hi> as again they hold, that the Father and the Son together have produced and breathed the holy Spirit by wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and loving. Which thing may be thus explained after the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries mind: There are in God only two operative Principles, or that have ſome power of working; whoſe operations may be both immanent (that is, may remain in God himſelf, and do not paſs into any other ſubject) and be employed about God himſelf; to wit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and will. For God both underſtands himſelf, and wills and loves himſelf as the chiefeſt good. Indeed the Omnipotence of God, is alſo an operative Principle: but its opperations are imployed only about other things, not about God himſelf, and are terminated to other ſubjects. Now from theſe things then the Adverſaries draw out the ſecond and third Perſons of the Divinity in this manner. They ſay, the underſtanding doth not underſtand, but by the Image of that thing which it underſtands. Wherefore ſince God hath underſtood himſelf from all eternity, it is neceſſary that he conceived an Image of himſelf alſo from all eternity. And this muſt be neceſſarily God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For they ſay, that both whatſoever is in God, is God by reaſon of his greateſt ſimplicity: and that Image of the infinite God muſt be infinite. But nothing is infinite beſides God. But they ſay that it is likewiſe neceſſary, that that Image be a diſtinct perſon from him that produced it, otherwiſe God ſhould have produced himſelf. Whence at laſt they conclude, that that Image is the Son of God; becauſe it is both produced, and like to the producer, as his Image, and the ſame in ſubſtance with him. But further, becauſe God loves himſelf being known, and that his Image, which by underſtanding he produced, and is again loved by it; this very act of will makes the third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Divinity. For both that love is in God, and infinite, and moreover, no leſs God than that Image produced by the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; but in perſon is neceſſarily diſtinct from them by whom he is produced. Theſe Myſteries do they open unto us concerning the production of two divine perſons, it is wonderful with what deep ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the holy Scriptures kept ſecret, and how forreign from thoſe things, which the ſame holy Scriptures do in moſt plain words deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver concerning the Generation of the Son by God: and in their due place<note n="*" place="margin">

Here they who cry out, that Reaſon is blind in divine things, who would not that any may diſpute from it againſt the Trinity, who have often that in their mouth, <hi>The ſearcher of the Majeſty, ſhall be oppreſſed by its Glory,</hi> as they think was written by <hi>Solomon:</hi> here, I ſay, they ought to cry out, that Reaſon is blind: that theſe ſearch the divine Majeſty: that it is unlawful to attempt to expreſs the unutterable Myſteries. But unleſs ſuch things had been deviſed, they had not at this day had their Trinity. But it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful how prepoſterouſly the Adverſaries do here behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:64944:145"/> For whilſt they do ſo urge the ſimplicity, that whatſoever is in God, they hold to be God, yet in the mean time bring in more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons into him, and, if you conſider the force of their opinion, infinite, or numberleſs, they by this very reaſon quite deſtroy the Simplicity. But that is yet more grievous, that whilſt they ſeem to be willing to have ſuch regard to the Simplicity, of which notwithſtanding the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures are ſilent, as being not neceſſary to be known to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and are altogether unknown to the more ſimple men, they take away the unity, which the holy Scriptures ſo often and ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inculcate. But let us now let paſs both theſe, and not a few other abſurdities, which are contained in this opinion; of which ſome are ſhewn above; ſome ſhall be ſhewn afterward: and let us demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that which a little before we propounded; to wit, that hence it follows, That the Son of God is his own Son. Neither is it difficult to demonſtrate that. For if the Eſſence, and moreover, the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Father and the Son, be the ſame in number, there is alſo the ſame operation in number of the underſtanding; eſpecially becauſe the more acute Adverſaries, by reaſon of the greateſt <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity</hi> of God, hold that his intellect and intellection are the ſame thing. Therefore if the Father hath begotten the Son by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his underſtanding, the Son alſo, whoſe the ſame operation was, begat himſelf. Yea, further, the holy Spirit begat that Son of God exiſting from eternity: and ſo is the Father of the Son, and Principle of his own Principle. For by the ſame intellection, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Father and Son from all eternity, he underſtood and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated himſelf and his Eſſence, and alſo even the Father and the Son. And ſo, becauſe with the ſame act of will, the holy Spirit, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Father and Son, willed and loved whatſoever they will and love: if the holy Spirit be a certain act of will, or ſomething pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Father and Son by the operation of will, the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit alſo hath produced himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, It is to be affirmed, that by this means, not only the ſame perſons have produced themſelves, but alſo infinite or innumerable others. For ſince each perſon underſtands both himſelf, and the other perſons, and deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>res, and loves them: it is neceſſary that each again produce more, both Sons and holy Spirits, if thoſe things be true, which they inculcate to us concerning the divine Intellection and love. For there muſt be a different, and ſo an unlike Image of the Father, as he is the Father; and of the Son, as he is the Son; and of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, as ſuch. For the Father and Son, as ſuch, are oppoſite between themſelves; and in like ſort the holy Spirit, as he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by both. For they are relatives: and all relatives, as we have ſaid above, are oppoſite: but there muſt be oppoſite Images of oppoſite things. However this be, there muſt be different Images of thoſe things which really differ, which may exactly expreſs them, and not only ſhew how they agree between themſelves, but alſo how they differ: But according to the diverſity and multitude of thoſe Images, there will ariſe alſo a multitude of acts of wil &amp; love, with which thoſe
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:64944:145"/> ſeveral perſons embrace thoſe Images; and again, thoſe Images pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the perſons, by which they are produced, and each alſo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and at length one another. Wherefore if both thoſe Images produced by the intellect, and thoſe acts of will in God are perſons, or at leaſt principles of <hi>divers</hi> perſons, the perſons will be <hi>in infinitum</hi> multiplyed. Although, if whatſoever is in God, be God; another way alſo will divine perſons ariſe. For in God there is an Image of every thing in particular, which he underſtands (if an intellection be not in God, but by an Image:) likewiſe both decrees of infinite things, and love towards things created, and divers acts of will: All theſe things therefore ſhall be God; yet ſhall differ in perſons from him, or thoſe, from whom they are produced. Therefore even thence, we ſhall have infinite or innumerable perſons in God.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>LEſt any one perhaps, ſhould think that they only ſhould fear an infinite multitude of divine perſons, who have deviſed that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of generation of the Son of God, and proceſſion of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which in the precedent chapter we have explained; we ſhall ſhew, that others alſo muſt hold the ſame, who will have the Son of God to have been generated from eternity out of the Eſſence of the Father: and moreover, ſince they ſee, that the infinite multitude of the divine perſons is moſt abſurd, they muſt acknowledge that alſo the Doctrine from whence it flows, is moſt abhorrent from the truth. For if God have begotten the Son out of his Eſſence, and again, together with the Son, have produced the holy Spirit, and theſe are with him the ſame God; there is no cauſe, why the son alſo hath not begotten ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Son again, and in like manner the holy Spirit another, and this alſo another, and ſo <hi>in infinitum.</hi> For what? cannot the Son and holy Spirit do what the Father could? Then they are not the ſame God with him, ſince they have not the ſame faculty and power, but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal one. Will you ſay, that they would not? But ſuch things, which pertain to things <hi>ad intra,</hi> or to within, as they ſpeak, in God are altogether neceſſary, and are not ſubject to the free will. But if they be ſubject to the free will, it may come to paſs, that within ſome time more divine perſons may grow, when thoſe perſons will, which hitherto would not beget or breath other perſons.</p>
                  <p>Some ſay therefore it cannot be, that the Son or holy Spirit ſhould produce another Son or holy Spirit, not becauſe there is ſome impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the Son and holy Spirit; but becauſe, whatſoever might be begotten or proceed in God, that hath been already begotten and

                     <note place="margin">There would be infinite Sons.</note> but that, which is already generated or produced, cannot any more be produced; for it ſhould at once both be, and not be: in which manner, neither this world, can be any more created by God, becauſe it is already in being; not by reaſon of any impotence in God, but by reaſon of the impotence of the thing it ſelf, as I may ſo ſay.

                     </gap>ies believe, that another world beſides this, may be created of God? I trow they do altogether believe it. Let us apply this to our purpoſe. That Son, which is already begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, cannot any more be begotten; neither that holy Spirit, which is already produced, can any more be produced. But what hinders another Son, or another holy Spirit to be produced by the Son and holy Spirit, and by them again others? ſince we have ſhewed<note n="*" place="margin">Sect. <hi>1.</hi> chap. <hi>7.</hi> of this Book.</note> above, that it follows from the Suppoſitions of the Adverſaries, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature is capable of infinite perſons in number.

                  </argument>
                  <p>LEt this be the third Argument, by which the ſame Doctrine is refelled, that thence it would follow, that Chriſt both did exiſt from all Eternity, and did not exiſt: that he alwayes was, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time was not. It muſt needs be that he was from all Eternity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both it is openly ſaid, that he was begotten from all eternity; and, if he had exiſt at laſt in a certain time, he would not be the moſt high God. For the moſt high God was exiſtent from all eternity. But that he was not from all eternity, is manifeſt from this very thing, that he was begotten, and indeed in reſpect of his Subſtance, and with a Generation properly ſo called.</p>
                  <p>You will here preſently cry out, and ſay, that you do eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what I would; to wit, that a Generation properly ſo called, is a change from <hi>not being, to being.</hi> Therefore if the Son of God was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly generated, he was ſometime <hi>no being,</hi> or ſometimes in very deed he was not exiſtent. I ſay, this very thing I would. But you will ſay, that that definition is to be admitted only concerning natural ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:64944:146"/> not concerning ſupernatural. But this generation of the Son of God out of the Eſſence of the Father, is ſupernatural, <label type="milestone">

For whence do they frame ſuch a Propoſition, but from humane things, and altogether natural? And indeed they even expreſly bring examples of Sons begotten by men, that they may eſtabliſh that Propoſition; neither can they bring any other. For what? are there perhaps ſome other only begotten, proper, natural, but ſupernaturally begotten Sons of any one extant, whom they may bring for an example, and from whom they may frame ſuch a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>opoſition? They will ſay, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the Son of God, in that agrees with the humane and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral generation, that the Son by it became like to the Father in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, not in that, that ſometime he was not exiſtent. But may you be allowed ſo to urge, when you liſt, the reaſon and ſimilitude of the natural generation; and when you liſt again, to refuſe it? So indeed the Adverſaries more than once hold forth the propriety of words, when it ſerves their cauſe; and when it doth withſtand, they reject it; change the received <hi>Axiomes</hi> and Definitions in Schools; inlarge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain and bow them like a <hi>Lesbian</hi> Rule to their opinion. Never did the boldneſs of humane wit permit it ſelf, to feign more things than concerning God, as being a thing remote from our ſences, in which it hath believed its devices could not ſo eaſily be detected.

But you ought ſo much the rather to have done this, becauſe you contend, &amp; that right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this Generation to be ſupernatural. For look over all ſupernatural &amp; divine Generations, you will find none, in which God hath begotten any thing out of his Eſſence. Neither may you want examples: there are as many as there are Angels, who are all called the Sons of God: as many as godly men, and believing in Chriſt there are extant; as many as there ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>all hereafter become immortal. For all theſe are either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, or as yet to be begotten of God; as is manifeſt from the holy Scriptures. Neither is there need you ſhould fear, leſt that in a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this ſort, you ſhould find no ſpecial manner, which may he either altogether peculiar to Chriſt, or ſo remarkable, as to exempt him from the catalogue of the reſt, and make him the only begotten Son of God. For thoſe things which are diſputed, both by us in the ſaid place, and by others elſewhere, will free you from this fear.</p>
                  <p>But beſides, that I may omit, that the Generation out of the Eſſence of him, who generates, ſuch as the Adverſaries will have Chriſts to be, even chiefly is natural, not ſupernatural; every Generation properly ſo called whatſoever, whether you would have it to be natural, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, is a change from <hi>not being,</hi> into <hi>being.</hi> So, namely, that it is neceſſary, that that which is begotten, did ſometime not exiſt, and afterward by the generation began to exiſt. For what? is not every Generation properly ſo called, a production and acquiſition of an Eſſence, I ſay, an acquiſition in reſpect of a begotten? But how can the Eſſence of that be produced, which doth already exiſt, and was in very deed alwayes in being? How can that acquire an Eſſence, which alwayes had it? Is not perhaps the ſupernatural Generation, although ſubſtantial, and properly ſo called, a production and acquiſition of an Eſſence or Subſtance? If it be not, we underſtand no more, no not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the name of the generation, when it is uttered concerning ſupernatural things; and you do uſe an unknown tongue, who tells us of ſuch a generation. But what ever at length you think, this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the holy Scriptures, when they mention the Generation of the Son of God, do ſpeak with us in a popular language; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do ſo ſpeak, that we may perceive the force and meaning of the words, although we do not thorowly underſtand the whole reaſon or nature of the thing. But go to: if it be not neceſſary, that that which is generated, ſhould not before exiſt, that may be generated, which now is very deed is exiſtent: and further, nothing will hinder, that he, who to day in very deed is, &amp; ceaſeth not to be; to morrow or the next day may properly be generated By this means he hath been in the end of the way to which he tends, before he hath entered into the way, or gone through it. For the generation is the way to <hi>to be;</hi> in very deed to be, or to have an Eſſence, is the end of that way. Who therefore doth not ſee that to be abſurd, and againſt all the nature of the Generation? That may indeed be conſerved which is already in being: but not genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But if the generation may be of a thing already exiſtent, as it
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:64944:147"/> exiſteth, the generation will be the conſervation of a thing. But the generation is the Antecedent of the conſervation; <hi>that</hi> produceth the thing; <hi>this</hi> upholds, it being produced. If therefore it be repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the nature of the generation, that that be generated, which already doth in very deed exiſt, it is neceſſary, that that, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is generated, ſometime was <hi>no being,</hi> or ſometime was not in very deed exiſtent.</p>
                  <p>They will perhaps ſay, that to that Generation, which may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by an Emanation, as they call it, it is not required, that the thing generated, ſometime ſhould not exiſt; for it is enough, that it hath not its Eſſence from it ſelf, but from another; to wit, from that from which it emanateth or flows. So the light, or beams, perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally flow from the Sun, and are generated, not therefore becauſe they were not before exiſtent, but becauſe they have not their Eſſence from themſelves, but from the Sun. For imagine, ſay they, the Sun to have been exiſtent from eternity, it will be neceſſary, that it begat light and beams from eternity; and ſo beams, although generated, ſhould have exiſted from eternity. But now they ſay, that the Son of God is begotten of the Father by an Emanation. For he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the Father, whilſt he underſtands himſelf, and conceives the image of himſelf; which action perpetually endureth. Likewiſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that the holy Spirit is produced by a continued act of the will. Of which thing we have treated above. But by this device they profit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For that I may let paſs other things mentioned above in the firſt chapter of this Section, the example of the Sun-beams, which they think to be moſt fitted to their opinion, makes not for it. Seeing we, with our Adverſaries, here ſpeak of the Generation properly ſo called. But there is no Generation, properly ſo called, of light and beams, ſince they are Accidents. But Generation properly ſo called, is not of Accidents, but of Subſtances only, as is well known. But if the Emanation of beams from the Sun, were a generation, properly ſo called, there had been no neceſſity, that the Adverſaries ſhould ſo carefully diſtinguiſh between the natural and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural generation, when we urge, that whatſoever is properly generated, it neceſſarily ſometime was not exiſtent, ſince the Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of beams from the Sun is natural; and if it be a Generation properly ſo called, then they will have an example of a natural gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, in which that, which is generated, even now before (as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves here urge) was exiſtent, and might alwayes be exiſtent. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thoſe things, which in a ſort are generated by an Emanation, have not a perfect and conſiſtent Eſſence, but their being, as they ſpeak, is in <hi>fieri;</hi> that is, they are only in being, in that they are produced, and paſs even as actions and motions. But the Son of God hath a perfect and conſiſtent, not tranſient Subſtance. Wherefore he is not begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by an Emanation.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Alſo in thoſe things, which continually do emanate, and in that regard are as it were generated, that is generated, which was not before exiſtent. For thoſe things have ſucceſſive parts, whereof one goes before, another follows; and that, which once was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:64944:148"/> becauſe it hath already received its being, is not generated any more, but another which was not yet exiſtent; wherefore if the light be generated perpetually by the Sun, another and another ſucceſſive part is ſtill generated Otherwiſe if the whole were once produced according to all parts which ſhould be ever exiſtent, it ſhould not be continually generated, but, being once produced, ſhould be conſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only. By theſe things, that alſo appears, that the Son of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be generated by a continued Emanation; or if they will have him to be generated by an Emanation, he cannot be the moſt high God. For the moſt high God hath not parts, by which he may be ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly generated; that I may forbear to ſay, that whatſoever is generated by an Emanation, whether perpetual, or not perpetual, the Eſſence of it depends on that, from which it flows. But the Eſſence of the moſt high God depends on none.</p>

                  <p>THe fourth Argument may be hence drawn, That if God have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the Son out of his Eſſence from eternity, he doth alſo now beget the ſame, and ſhall beget him unto eternity. Which thing even many of the Adverſaries confeſs, they eſpecially; who ſay that the Son is generated of God by the intellection. For that intellection perpetually endureth; and will endure unto all ages. But not only they, who acknowledge ſuch a manner of the generatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ter, a not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getter, which change, ſince it reſpects not the creatures, but abides within God himſelf, befalls not God, nor is acknowledged by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to befall him. Add, that either the Son is not the moſt high God, or was begotten of the Father by neceſſity of nature. For if the Father had not begotten him by neceſſity of nature, he had begotten him freely and contingently. But he is nor the moſt high God, who exiſts contingently, not neceſſarily. But if God have begotten the Son by neceſſity of nature, he doth perpetually beget him, ſince his nature is alwayes altogether the ſame. Beſides, with God, if we believe the Adverſaries, there is no diſtinction of time, but the whole eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is gathered together at once with him, and contracted to a certain point.</p>
                  <p>Therefore whatſoever he doth, it is neceſſary, that he doth it in all eternity, and ſo perpetually. Add, that not a few urge that of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7. <hi>To day have I begotten thee.</hi> For they ſay, that the word of the

But it ſhould not ſignifie that, unleſs it might have the force of the time paſt. But what need we many words? The thing it ſelf ſhews, that he, who is already long ago in very deed, and perfectly extant, as it is manifeſt, that the Son of God is extant, cannot be any more begotten: which both we have before proved by Reaſon, and all they acknowledge, whoſe minds th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:64944:149"/> wont to hide that their myſtery, from men ignorant of that their Philoſophy, unleſs when they are conſtrained in ſome manner to open it; becauſe they ſee they ſhall not eaſily be credited by them; and it ſeems abſurd to any in his wits, that the Son of God, whom he knows to have been exiſtent in very deed for ſo many ages paſt, ſhould now be begotten, and to be begotten perpetually.</p>
                  <p>That alſo may be added to the Argument already brought: That ſince a perſon is nothing elſe but a firſt intelligent Subſtance, as was ſhewed in the foregoing Section; if the ſecond perſon of the Deity be begotten out of the Subſtance of the firſt, there will be two Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in God, the one of the firſt perſon, out of which the Son was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; the other, which is the Son himſelf. Which alſo follows from this, that a generation, properly ſo called, ſuch as they will have the Generation of the Son of God to be, is not but of a Subſtance: Now a ſubſtance cannot be born but of a ſubſtance. Yet again, if the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Son be born, and the Subſtance of the Son and Father be the ſame in number, it follows that the Subſtance of the Father is alſo born, and indeed from it ſelf. Therefore alſo the Father is the Son of himſelf. For how is he not begotten, whoſe ſubſtance is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten? How is he not his Son, out of whoſe ſubſtance he is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? There might alſo other Arguments be brought, but we will be now content with theſe.</p>

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:64944:149"/> We will here bring ſome only, and thoſe more pertinent to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent matter. For firſt, thence it follows, that not only the Son, <label type="milestone">

                     <note place="margin">Becauſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the holy Spirit had been incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.</note> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Father and holy Spirit have aſſumed a humane nature. For he hath aſſumed an humane nature, whoſe proper nature or ſubſtance hath aſſumed it, and with it is perſonally united. But if the divine Nature of Chriſt hath aſſumed an humane nature, alſo the proper Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Father, and the holy Spirit hath aſſumed it, if ſo be, it be the ſame in number in thoſe three perſons. And indeed the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the errour, hath made, that ſome of the Adverſaries have not feared to ſay, that the whole Trinity was incarnated; and lately there was one<note n="*" place="margin">Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide, a Jeſuite, in his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary on the leſſer Prophets</note> of a certain chief Sect of the Adverſaries, a man of a moſt famous name amongſt them, and now indeed teaching Divinity at <hi>Rome,</hi> who dedicated his Book to the uncreated Trinity, and in Jeſus Chriſt created.

So the Hereſy of thoſe Antients, whether <hi>Sabellians,</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tripaſſians,</hi> condemned by the Adverſaries themſelves, will revive. And indeed, if you conſider the thing rightly, the common opinion of the Trinity is nothing elſe but a <hi>Sabellianiſm,</hi> a little more ſubtilly propounded and varniſhed with ſome new colours, and choaked with new names. For the ſame God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> number, conſidered with this mode or ſubſiſtence, is the Father; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For the ſame God in number, and the ſame ſubſtance, is alſo in very deed the ſame perſon, having three different modes or ſubſiſtences.</p>
                  <p>But that we may return to that, which we began to do, they will ſay, that the divine Nature indeed or ſubſtance, did aſſume the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, but not in every ſubſiſtence, but only in the ſubſiſtence of the Son: to this only that union or conjunction of the humane and divine Nature, is terminated. You would ſay, that theſe men ſaw with their very eyes that Incarnation, who know to explain ſo accurately, in which ſubſiſtence that union was terminated, although there are three ſubſiſtences in the ſame nature, not really as they ſpeak, different from it. But that the vanity of this device may be ſhewed, let us ſomewhat explain what they would; if ſo be that the matter may be underſtood. True and real union, ſuch as that ſhould be, which is deviſed by the Adverſaries, is at leaſt between two things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of of the one explain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, or applies its <hi>terminos</hi> or extremities, whether properly or improperly ſo called to the other. The caſe is clear in bodily things, which we ſee with the eyes, and from which the word <hi>terminus,</hi> which they uſe in this matter, is taken. For a board is joyned to a board, a ſtone to a ſtone, whilſt the ſuperfices of the one is joyned to the ſuperficies of the other: but the ſuperficies is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, or a certain <hi>terminus</hi> of a body. But becauſe a ſuperficies of ſome whole body is extended through al its ſides, and for examples
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:64944:150"/> ſake, one part of it is before, another behind; therefore it may come to paſs, that the union and conjunction of two bodies is not termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto every part of the ſuperficies or body. So two ſquare ſtones touch one another according to the ſuperficies only of one ſide; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perhaps the one includes the other, and then the outer ſuperficies of the containing ſtone, will not touch the ſuperficies of the contained in any part; wherefore to that outer ſuperficies of the containing ſtone, that union or conjunction will not be terminated, but to the inner only. Now in things incorporeal, there are properly no <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> or extremities, no diverſity of ſuch parts. Whence it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, if the humane nature was joyned to the divine, which all hold to be incorporeal, that it was joyned to the whole divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But yet with our Adverſaries, inſtead of divers <hi>termini,</hi> there are divers ſubſiſtences or modes of the divine nature; whereof one makes the Father, another the Son, a third the holy Spirit. Now they ſay, that this perſonal union is terminated to the ſubſiſtence of the Son, or ſo far the humane nature is joyned to the divine, as this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the Son, but not as it ſubſiſts in the Father or holy Spirit; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Adverſaries uſually explain the matter more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely. But either this is it the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> But they do nothing. For if the whole divine nature be joyned to the humane, and there be three ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtences in that whole nature, whereof one differs no more from the Eſſence than another, or is more throughly faſtned to it, the humane nature alſo is no more joyned to one ſubſiſtence, than to another, and ſo that union is terminated no more to one than to another, and the humane nature no more ſubſiſts in the ſubſiſtence of one perſon than of another. Yea, if there could be any difference between theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtences, it ſhould ſubſiſt rather in the ſubſiſtence of the Father, as being that which is the firſt in the divine nature, and upon which the two others do as it were lean, than of the Son and holy Spirit. Which that it may be made ſo much the more clear, that is to be remembred, which we ſhewed before, that they hold that there is a certain real union between the two natures, and moreover, that the one nature is joyned to the other nature firſt, and by it ſelf; but to thoſe things which are in the nature, only conſequently. For nothing can really be joyned and united with the moſte of the thing, but with the thing it ſelf. We ſee that in the conjunction of body and ſoul, which exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple among all other things they judge to be moſt like to that hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical union. For the body is firſt and by it ſelf joyned unto the ſoul: conſequently to thoſe things which are in the Soul, or to its modes, as to exiſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce, or if there be any other thing, which they may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to call a mode. But if the body he only ſecondarily joyned to thoſe things which are in the ſoul, it cannot be joyned more to one of them, than to another, unleſs perhaps one be more or before in
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:64944:150"/> the ſoul, than the reſt. But it is already ſhewed, that the ſubſiſtence of the Son, is not in this manner in the divine Eſſence. But moreover, although in ſome regard the humane nature ſhould be more joyned to the ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

For how is not that whole incarnated, the whole Eſſence of which is incarnated? Add, that ſince thoſe ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtences exiſt not without the Eſſence, yea, are in very deed the ſame with it; it is neceſſary that thoſe ſubſiſtences alſo be incarnated toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it.

For it is eaſie to be ſhewed, both by reaſon and the authority of the Philoſopher, that it is an accident, which is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent not as a part, and may be abſent from that, in which it is. Now if the humane nature of Chriſt be not a part of Chriſt; all that which we have ſaid agrees to it. For it is in the perſon of Chriſt, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in it, as the Adverſaries would. But now it will not be a part. Laſtly, it may be abſent from that in which it is, to wit, the divine Perſon or Nature of Chriſt. For ſhould the divine Nature or Perſon periſh, if the humane ſhould be ſeparated from it? I ſay not that it ſhall be ſeparated; which they deny ſhall ever be: But if it ſhould be ſeparated, the divine Perſon ſhould not be deſtroyed: which is enough in this place. For there are alſo inſeparable accidents, as they are caled in the Schools; which although they are never ſeparated from the <hi>ſubjectum,</hi> yet it is therefore ſaid, that they may be abſent from it, becauſe if it were ſuppoſed, that they are ſeparated from that, in which they are, yet it would not be neceſſary, that the thing it ſelf ſhould periſh. But if the humane nature be an accident of the perſon of Chriſt, how is the perſon of Chriſt, or the Son of God a man? Chriſt might indeed be ſaid to be humane, but not a man. For that which is an accident to another, is not predicated of it <hi>ſynonymically,</hi> or <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally,</hi> but <hi>paronymically?</hi> So a Cup, to which Gold adhers, as an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, is ſaid to be golden or gilded, not a gold; an Iron, in which is fire, is ſaid to be fired, not a fire; and ſo in the reſt.</p>
                  <p>But beſides, how is not that a whole, which is one thing, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of two things ſeparable in their nature? But ſuch is Chriſt. For he is ſome one thing, conſiſting of a divine and humane nature, either of which in its nature is ſeparable; although this, according to their opinion is not to be ſeparated. How therefore is not the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a part of Chriſt? If it be, then the other part will be the divine Nature, having its ſubſiſtences that is, the divine perſon, which hath aſſumed the humane But a perſon, as we have ſeen, cannot be the part of another, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Perhaps ſome will ſay, that the Iron fired, is ſome thing united of an Iron and Fire; and yet the Iron it ſelf doth not looſe the reaſon or nature of a Suppoſitum, but only the Fire ſubſiſting in it. Wherefore although Chriſt be ſomewhat conſiſting of a divine perſon &amp; humane nature, yet not <hi>that</hi> but <hi>this</hi> looſeth the reaſon or nature of a perſon, becauſe this ſubſiſts in that. For in this part there is the ſame reaſon of a perſon, and a ſuppoſitum: becauſe that, of which we diſpute, whether it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal a perſon, may therefore befal it, or not befal it, becauſe it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal or not befal a ſuppoſitum.

                  <p>Neither indeed may you think, thoſe things are ſaid of Chriſt <hi>ſynec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochycally,</hi> the names of parts being put for the whole.

For this expreſſion is proper and accurate; the other improper and figurate; to wit, a man is a ſoul, a man is fleſh. But who would brook him that ſayes, Chriſt is not God, is not man? Add that hower the parts are wont to be ſaid <hi>ſynecdochycally</hi> of the whole, yet are they not wont to be predicated mutually of themſelves. For I do not ſay, fleſh is the ſoul or ſpirit; or on the contrary, the ſoul is fleſh. But here <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man</hi> are predicated of each other mutually.

But what other firſt intelligent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances do remain there, which are not perſons? You will ſay, the ſouls of men ſeparated from their bodies. For they are firſt, or ſingular, and intelligent ſubſtances. For they may underſtand, and ſo in very deed do underſtand, being ſeparated from bodies. But if the thing be ſo, why are they not perſons?

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:64944:153"/> are natural parts of men, or are by nature appointed to it, that they may conſtitute ſome whole. What? are not the natural parts of the ſubſtances diſ-joyned from each o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>her ſuppoſitums? Certainly, as it is the common, ſo alſo the moſt true opinion of the Schools, that they are Suppoſitums at that time. For it matters not, that they either have been, or may be naturally parts of other things; if ſo be that now in very deed they are not, but by themſelves make up ſome wholes. The actions of ſuppoſitums agree properly to them, and to each ſeparate actions. Surely to the humane ſouls, if the opinion of the Adverſaries be true, not only actions do agree, but alſo even the moſt excllent, and moſt proper to perſons, to wit, to underſtand and will, and if there be any conjoyned with theſe. How then ſhall they not be ſuppoſitums, how not perſons? But if they be not perſons, let not the actions proper to perſons, be aſcribed to them. Which will be done, if you ſhall ſay, that thoſe ſouls, as long as they ſubſiſt ſeparate, cannot a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tually underſtand. For the ſoul is not intelligent, <hi>ut quod,</hi> or, as which (we ſpeak with the Schools) but <hi>ut quo,</hi> or, as by which, that is, it doth not by it ſelf underſtand, but is that by which the man underſtands. Therefore as long as the man himſelf is not his ſoul, by it ſelf cannot underſtand. But ſince a perſon is defined, a firſt ſubſtance intelligent, or an intelligent ſuppoſitum, that is ſaid to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

With what inſtance then will they infringe our definition? Whether by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that nature of which we diſpute? But that cannot be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out begging of the Queſtion. Will they ſay the humane Nature of Chriſt is not intelligent <hi>ut quo,</hi> or, as which; but <hi>ut quo,</hi> or, as by which? Then it will not be a ſubſtance endued with underſtanding; as we are; and ſo neither a humane nature. For every ſubſtance endued with underſtanding, is intelligent <hi>ut quod,</hi> or, as which; that is, it ſelf by its act is able to underſtand. Of which thing we ſhall ſay more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond reaſon by which it is proved, that the humane Nature of Chriſt is a perſon, is this, that it is a man, I ſay a ſingular or individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al man, and the ſon of man. But he who is a man, or the ſon of man, is a perſon: for theſe are names of perſons. Whence ſome more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Adverſaries, will not call the humane nature in Chriſt a man; and they ſay not a miſs, that this phraſe ſavours of Neſtorianiſm, if any ſay, <hi>God</hi> aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> a humanity, or humane nature. Beſides if the humane Nature of Chriſt be in very deed a man, and the ſon of man, no man may doubt that thoſe things are to be underſtood of it, which are ſaid of the man Jeſus Chriſt, or the Son of man; as Chriſt calls himſelf in the holy<note n="*" place="margin">

But that ſon of man is called the Son of God; or on the contrary, the Son of God is called the Son of man: The man Chriſt is called the Mediator; and other things are attributed to him, which by all mens confeſſion, agree
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:64944:154"/> not but to a perſon. Certainly if that man be not a perſon, it will be lawful ſo to argue. The ſon of man is not a perſon; the ſon of God is that ſon of man; therefore that ſon of God is not a perſon. But it is manifeſt by the definition of a man, that the humane nature of Chriſt, which they fear to call a man, is in very deed and properly a man. For <hi>to which</hi> the definition agrees, <hi>to</hi> it alſo the thing defined agrees. For as much as the thing defi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Was it not endued with a ſenſitive ſoul? He hath put off all ſenſe and reaſon, who dares to deny it. Therefore the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of Chriſt is a man. But of its ſingularity, or individua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, who doubts? But if he be a man, he alſo is the ſon of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well becauſe the holy Scriptures put promiſcuouſly the ſon of man, and a man, as alſo is commonly known; as becauſe he who being a man, is born of a woman, cannot but be in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Perhaps ſome one will ſay, that the humane nature of Chriſt, to ſpeak properly and accurately, is neither a man, nor an animal, nor a body, but Chriſt endued with humane nature, is both a man, and an animal, and a body: becauſe a man and animal, are <hi>concretums,</hi> and likewiſe a body, when it is put for the genus of a man: but that the humane nature of Chriſt is an <hi>abſtractum.</hi> But we on the contrary: if the humane nature of Chriſt, ſpeaking properly and acurately, be a corporeal ſubſtance, which no man can deny, but he that believes not ſenſe any more, the ſame alſo is an animal, ſince it is en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore that which they ſay, that it is ſome <hi>abſtractum,</hi> and call it <hi>humanity,</hi> or the humane nature, not a man, reſts on their bare opinion. But beſides, what is with them <hi>humanity, corporeity, animality</hi> abſtract? They will not ſay, that they are univerſals, as it were ſevered in the mind from ſingulars, which ſort of <hi>abſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>actums</hi> we willingly admit in the kind of the ſubſtances; for this makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here to the purpoſe, ſince the humane nature of Chriſt is ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and one in number. Alſo they will not ſay, that it is the form of a man, animal, or body. For neither doth t is make any whit to the purpoſe, ſince the humane nature of Chriſt is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the form of a man, but ſomething endued with a form; not a part of the humane eſſence, but the whole eſſence. What therefore are in their opinion thoſe <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractums?</hi> Are they the ſingular nature of a man, an animal, or ſome
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:64944:154"/> body, abſtracted from all theſe things which are not required to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute it, and conſidered barely by it ſelf? Firſt, what conſtraines to conſider ſo the humane nature of Chriſt? ſince in it there were many things not belonging to the conſtitution of the eſſence of the humanity it ſelf, as in other men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that I may more nearly touch thoſe things, which are wont commonly to be looked on in ſuch <hi>concretums;</hi> there was in him an exiſtence proper to <hi>ſingulars,</hi> of which no regard is had in the definition of the ſpecies and genus; there were <hi>differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> which they call <hi>individuating:</hi> it was exiſtent in a certain place, in a certain time; I ſay it was a <hi>being</hi> in very deed exiſting, and, as other ſubſtances, <hi>ſubſiſting:</hi> but ſuch things are not wont to be called abſtractums. Beſides, I cannot ſee, why a whole eſſence, and in all the parts abſolute, which is really exiſting, although it be abſtracted in the mind from thoſe things which are in it, deſerves not the name of its ſpecies or genus: why, I ſay, this humane nature, which is indeed exiſtent (for of this we ſpeak) ought not to be called a man, or this entire nature of an animal, animal. In vain the latter Philoſophers ſeem here to have ſought a diſtinction unknown to the Antients, and by reaſon of difference of words (although alſo it was neceſſary to feign thoſe ſimple abſtract words of the ſubſtances, as of the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, taken for the humane nature, animality, corporeity) to have brought in a certain difference of the thing, and ſignification it ſelf. But perhaps they will ſay, that the humane nature of Chriſt ſubſiſts not by it ſelf, but ſubſiſts in the perſon of the Son of God, by whoſe proper ſubſiſtence it is ſuſtained. Therefore he either ought not to be called a man; or if he be called a man, yet he is not a perſon.</p>
                  <p>But that I may omit now other things to be ſaid a little after, that ſubſiſtence, which they ſay the humane nature of Chriſt wants, either appertains to the conſtitution of the nature of a man, or appertains not to it. If it appertains to it, the humane nature of Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it will not be entire: and ſo Chriſt ſhall not be a perfect man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the mind of the holy Scriptures, and the Adverſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: If it appertains not to it, its abſence will no whit hinder, but that the humane nature of Chriſt may be properly called a man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is proved by this, that the humane nature of Chriſt is a perſon; becauſe it in proper ſpeaking doth act, and ſuſtains certain offices. But a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tions, as often we have minded, after the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e Schools, are not properly but of ſuppoſitums, which if they be endued with underſtanding, by the confeſſion of all are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Likewiſe alſo offices are proper to perſons, as alſo the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries confeſs it. But now that the humane nature of Chriſt properly acts, is proved by that, that it doth alſo really ſubſiſt, and hath in it ſelf a ſtrength or power alſo and faculties ſufficient to act. For it hath not leſs than any man; yea, by ſo much greater, by how much greater gifts and greater power is given it of God.</p>
                  <p>But what is required to it, that any thing may in proper ſpeaking act, but that it may really ſubſiſt, and have in it ſelf a ſtrength or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſufficient to act? Surely it ſhould be denyed that we do properly
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:64944:155"/> act, if that might be denyed of the humane nature of Chriſt, which, as we have ſaid in thoſe things, that are required to the action proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called, doth not only equal us, but alſo in many reſpects exceed. And that we may declare that thing more peculiarly, doth not it, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing properly, by it ſelf underſtand, and reaſon? Then it is not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent ſubſtance, and endued with a rational ſoul, and further, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an humane. For that is an intelligent ſubſtance, that can, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with ſome acceſs of uſe and exerciſe, really, I ſay, properly, not improperly, underſtand and reaſon. But even the underſtanding alone would ſuffice to prove its perſon, for it is proper to perſons, as alſo we have before minded.</p>
                  <p>Further, Take now other actions, whether proper to men or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, as to will, deſire, eat, drink, move it ſelf in a place, and ſtirs its members to act. If the humane nature had not faculties to exerciſe theſe actions, either it was not an humane nature at all, or it was mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med either in reſpect of the body, or ſoul. The Truth, or the Adverſaries opinion admits neither. The Antiquity condemned the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> who held one only will in Chriſt. But if there were in him a double will, one in the divine nature, another in the humane; as the divine nature hath willed, and doth will by its proper will; ſo alſo the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by its; for wherefore elſe ſhould it be in it? Faculties are for actions. And ſurely his humane will ſhewed forth it ſelf abundantly,<note n="*" place="margin">

Although here it might be enough for us, that this nature might properly will; for that ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ees not but to Suppoſitums.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps they will ſay, that the humane nature did not ſubſiſt by it ſelf, but in the perſon of the Son of God, and therefore alſo by it ſelf could act nothing. For that which ſubſ ſts not by it ſelf, doth nothing alſo by it ſelf. Wherefore all the actions properly and directly, are not to be aſcribed to the humane nature, by which they are performed, but to whole Chriſt, although according to the humane nature. For in whole Chriſt, or his perſon, they are term<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nated and founded. But if you would directly aſcribe thoſe actions to the humane nature it ſelf, the expreſſion or ſpeaking would be improper; as when I ſay, the ſoul underſtands, wills, feels: when yet the ſoul doth not properly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, will, feel, but the man with, or by, or according to the ſoul. So neit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er doth the body eat, drink, but the man himſelf by the body: So laſtly, nei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Which things let us conſider of what moment they are: and firſt that, why they deny the humane nature of Chriſt to ſubſiſt by it ſelf. Now the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e may be a threefold meaning of that expreſſion, which may here come into ones mind. For firſt, that may be ſaid to <hi>ſubſiſt by it ſelf,</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eeds not any <hi>ſubjectum,</hi> in which it may in here, and from which if it be removed, it will looſe its being. In this manner all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſubſiſt by themſelves; accidents do not ſubſ ſt, thoſe, namely, which are wont commonly to be diſtributed into nine Categories, or Predicaments. In this manner the humane nature, by the Adverſaries
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:64944:155"/> confeſſion ſubſiſts by it ſelf? for it is a ſubſtance, not an accident, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would not be an <hi>humane nature.</hi> Beſides, that <hi>ſubſiſts by it ſelf,</hi> which needs not at all any outward prop, that it may ſubſiſt, and be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved entire and ſafe. In this manner no created thing, and depending on another, ſubſiſts by it ſelf. But that hinders not, but that the things deſtitute of this way of ſubſiſting by themſelves, act properly, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to any one. For things corruptible, and chiefly men, want both many cauſes, that at firſt they may exiſt, and many helps, that they may be conſerved; and yet they do properly act. Wherefore that will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hinder the humane nature, that it ſhould not, ſpeaking properly, act.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That ſubſiſts by it ſelf, which is not a part of another, but conſtitutes ſome whole by it ſelf, and abſolute in all its reſpects. In this manner the parts of any thing, whether integrant or eſſential, are not ſaid to ſubſiſt by themſelves, and therefore not to act by themſelves, but the whole by them. And hitherto belong all thoſe examples brought a little before. Perhaps in this manner the Adverſaries will ſay, that the humane nature of Chriſt doth not ſubſiſt by it ſelf: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a part of another ſuppoſitum, to wit, of whole Chriſt, or his perſon. But if the thing be ſo, neither that ſecond perſon of the Divinity, with which the humane is ſaid to be united, and which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the other part of the ſame ſuppoſitum, ſhall properly any more act any thing. So a divine perſon, that is of the ſupream God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who, ſpeaking properly, hath acted, is become that, which, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing properly, cannot act, than which nothing can be thought more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. For certainly if the humane nature be a part, there will be alſo ſome other part of the ſame whole. But what is it beſides the perſon, by which it is aſſumed, and with which it is ſaid to be united? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this alſo will be a part, and conſequently will no more ſubſiſt by it ſelf (to wit, in that manner of ſubſiſting which we now handle) than the humane nature. But beſides, if the humane nature of Chriſt be full and perfect, conſiſting of a humane body, and a rational ſoul, both of them abſolute in all reſpects; is it not by it ſelf an entire thing, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faculties ſufficient to act? Certainly if you deny any of theſe, either you will deny the entireneſs of the humane nature, or you will deny alſo that we our ſelves are ſuch entire things. The Adverſaries being conſtrained by the very truth of the thing, grant the humane Nature of Chriſt to be by it ſelf an eſſential whole, neither dare they ſay it is an integrant part of Chriſt, becauſe they hold thoſe only to be integrant parts which have quantity. Wherefore if Chriſt ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of a humane nature and a divine as integrant parts, alſo the divine nature being the other part of this ſuppoſitum, would have quantity. Therefore ſome ſay that the divine and humane nature are as it were eſſential parts, or like eſſential parts: and that the humane nature is as it were the matter and thing to be perfected, the divine, as it were, the form and thing perfecting. But whilſt they ſay this, they thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, thoſe Natures to be improperly called parts, but properly wholes: or at leaſt if the divine Nature cannot be termed a whole, becauſe it is
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:64944:156"/> deſtitute of parts; the humane Nature by it ſelf to be ſome whole conſiſting of all eſſential and integrant parts. But this indeed is to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt by it ſelf, when that expreſſion is taken in the third ſignification, which was ſet down by us. Wherefore in vain do the Adverſaries, when they ſay, that that ſubſiſtence of which we ſpeak, may by divine power be ſeparated from an entire and perfect ſubſtance, ſuch as is the humane natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e in Chriſt. And I believe indeed it may be ſeparated, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> together it ceaſe to be perfect and entire, and becomes either an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of ſome thing, or integrant growing together with another bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But that it remaining perfect, and making up an eſſential and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegral whole by it ſelf, ſhould not ſubſiſt by it ſelf, implies a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. For that would be that it compleats a whole by it ſelf, and doth not compleat it, that it both is entire and perfect by it ſelf, and is not. And this reaſon indeed doth not only ſhew that actions properly agree to the humane Nature, whence further it is concluded, that it is a ſuppoſitum and perſon; but alſo doth immediately ſhew that. For if the humane Nature be a ſubſtance ſubſiſting by it ſelf, to wit, in that ſtricter manner of ſubſiſting by it ſelf, which we expounded in the third place, it is altogether a ſuppoſitum; for as much as this ſubſiſtence, is the form of a ſuppoſitum, by which a ſuppoſitum is a ſuppoſitum; as the Adverſaries themſelves teach: who alſo bring no other cauſe, nor can by their opinion, why the humane nature of Chriſt is not a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum, and further, not a perſon, than becauſe it is deſtitute of that ſubſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>But that we may return to actions; Thence alſo it is manifeſt, that they properly agree to the humane Nature, becauſe othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>wiſe it ſhould be neceſſary to hold, that all Chriſts actions; whatſoever at length they have been, are to be properly attributed to his divine ſuppoſitum, as it is a ſuppoſitum; or that that divine ſuppoſitum hath properly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed thoſe actions. But thence ariſe thoſe abſurdities which my mind abhors even to think of. For all natural actions proper to humane imperfection, and our mortality, which are common to man with brutes: ſome alſo, however neceſſary, yet uncomely, ſhall properly agree not to the humane Nature, but to the divine Suppoſitum it ſelf; that is, to God himſelf, as he is a Suppoſitum.

                     </gap>eadful and moſt glorious Majeſty, and doth the greateſt injury to the moſt holy Religion of Chriſt. Which by this means he expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to the mockery of thoſe which are without. Surely that ſhould be far from them who ſo much abhor to aſcribe any accident to God, or any genus, and the like: which although they were erronious, yet they could be both conceived, and ſpoken without diſparagement to his Majeſty. But ſo it uſually comes to paſs, that they which ſtrain at a Gnat, ſwallow an Elephant; and they whom thoſe things which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain only to the philoſophical ſubtlety, would be wary even to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, but in theſe things which touch the reverence of the Deity, they are more than careleſs.</p>
                  <p>Therefore that we may return to our purpoſe, ſince it is ſufficiently,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:64944:156"/> ſhewed, that actions do properly agree to the humane Nature, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo eaſy to ſhew, that offices alſo agree to the ſame.</p>
                  <p>For, firſt, that the humane Nature of Chriſt may bear ſome office, that which would here be ſufficient for us, it is eaſie to demonſtrate. For he that may diſcharge actions proper to intelligent beings, and thoſe very eminent, may alſo bear ſome office. For what elſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the office in general? Beſides, the ſame is without difficulty ſhewed in particular. Three offices of Chriſt are held by all, Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, Prieſtly and Kingly. The part of the firſt is to expound &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the divine Will to men. Of the ſecond, to offer to God, and to intercede for ſinners. Of the third, to govern, keep and ſave the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, although alſo to ſave belongs to the Prieſtly office; of which here is not place to ſpeak: But do not theſe offices agree to the humane Nature of Chriſt? It is the office of a Prophet not to ſpeak in his own name, but anothers, to wit, Gods (for God when he ſpeaks in his own perſon, doth not execute a Prophets office) and to deliver Oracles or Doctrines unto others received from him.<note place="margin">See Book <hi>1.</hi> chap. <hi>2.</hi> Sect. <hi>8.</hi>
                     </note> And Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaith of himſelf, that he heard the things which he ſpeak, from the Father; that he was taught of him; that he received command from him what he ought to ſpeak; that his Doctrine was not his own, but his, who ſent him. All which things the Adverſaries will have to have been ſaid of Chriſt according to his humane Nature; nor can they otherwiſe. For the divine Nature or Perſon, as ſuch, cannot learn, or receive commandments: all things, which he hath or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, are his, not anothers. But if the humane Nature properly doth not act, we muſt ſay, that the divine Perſon properly hath done thoſe things, which are ſaid to have been done according to it: It therefore hath properly heard of the Father, hath properly learned, received commands; and further, hath ſpoken by anothers command; hath promulged anothers not his own Doctrine; it properly hath mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Prophetick office: likewiſe alſo hath wrought piety, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, chaſtity; and other vertues: hath done miracles by divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: hath by its death confirmed his Doctrine: which was the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Prophetick Office.</p>
                  <p>Now that we may come to the Prieſtly office: To intercede for another with God, agreeth not to God himſelf, nor to a divine Perſon, as ſuch; as even the Adverſaries themſelves do ſee; likewiſe neither to offer to God; eſpecially becauſe by the expiatory oblation it ſelf, the interceſſion is made with God for another. Therefore it is neceſſary, that it be ſaid, that Chriſt hath done thoſe things according to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature. Whence further it follows, for the reaſon a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alleaged, that the humane Nature hath done, or does thoſe things, and ſo performs the Office of a Prieſt.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Since we ſee that Chriſt is ſaid to have been made and anointed by God a King, and that all Power is given him in Heaven and in Earth, ſince it is neceſſary to underſtand thoſe things of Chriſt according to the humane Nature; it follows that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature hath that Power; and further, alſo doth exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it; which belongs to a King.</p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:64944:157"/>
                  <p>Theſe things are plain; and have in them no ſcruple and difficulty. There is no need here of communication of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties: There is no need to diſtinguiſh ſubtilly between Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions <hi>in concreto,</hi> and <hi>in abſtracto:</hi> to difference the Perſon from the Nature; again, one Nature from another: to ſeek how you may attribute humane things to the moſt high God, and things proper to the moſt high God, to a Man; how the ſame Perſon one while governs as the moſt high God, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while as a Mediator, and ſo the ſame perſon is in ſome ſort di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from himſelf,</p>
                  <p>Now from that which hath been ſaid, that may alſo be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, That there was no heed of the Union of two Natures. For if there had been need of it, it had been for this cauſe, That Chriſt might bear and manage thoſe Offices. But Chriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And indeed the confirming our faith and hope, and the Glory of the moſt high God required ſuch a Kingdom. But if any ſay, that greater than humane ability or power was requiſite to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge thoſe Offices, that would be of ſome moment, if it had been neceſſary, that he ſhould have that ability or power from himſelf, nor could receive them from God himſelf. But now ſince he both might receive them from God, and the holy Scriptures ſo often teſtifie, that he hath received them from God, what need was there, that he ſhould be the moſt high God? Rightly they ſay commonly, <hi>God and Nature do nothing in vain;</hi> although God doth thoſe things alſo that Nature doth. But if God does not things unneceſſary; much leſs thoſe things which hinder, and are otherwiſe unbeſeeming his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.

               </argument>
               <p>WE have ſaid enough of the ſecond Perſon which is held to be in the Trinity. It remains that we add ſomething alſo of the third. There is no need that we ſhould ſay much of it, becauſe thoſe things which have been ſaid of the Sons Generation out of the Eſſence of the Father, being a little changed, may be applied to that proceſſion of the holy Spirit, which the Adverſaries have deviſed. For which reaſon we alſo before ſometimes have expreſly joyned the holy Spirit with the Son, and ſo anticipated the treating of thoſe things, which might have been here alleaged: nor did we that without cauſe. For if you rightly mark it, both the Generation of the Eſſence of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is ſome Proceſſion; and on the contrary, ſuch a Proceſſion, as the Adverſaries attribute to the holy Spirit, is like that Generation, which the Adverſaries attribute to the Son of God. The former the more l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rned of the Adverſaries do confeſs, who treating of the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Son, and Proceſſion of the holy Spirit, ſay, That there are two P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oceſſions in God. But why the word <hi>Proceſſion</hi> is accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted perticularly to the holy Spirit, and ſo is diſtinguiſhed from the Generation of the Son, they aſſign this to be the Reaſon, Becauſe there is a ſpecial word wanting, by which that proper and peculiar manner, whereby the holy Spirit proceeds from the Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her and Son, may be deſigned. Therefore, as in other things it oft comes to paſs,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:64944:158"/> the general name is attributed as proper to the ſpecies, and ſo is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the other ſpecies. But that the Proceſſion alſo of the holy Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it is a Generation, if that Generation of the Son of God, which the Adverſaries hold, be indeed a Generation, is not hard to demonſtrate. For what other thing is required to a Generation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to called, than that one receive his Eſſence from another, either the ſame in kind, or (as the Adverſaries opinion of God is) in number with his Eſſence, from whom he receives it? In brief, generation properly ſo called, is a communication of a ſubſtance with another. And is not that Proceſſion of the holy Spirit, deviſed by the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, ſuch a communication? Did not the holy Spirit by that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, receive the ſame eſſence in number with the eſſence of them from whom hee proceeded? So indeed Adverſaries think and contend. But if the Proceſſion of the holy Spirit be a Generation, properly ſo called; we have in the Trinity two Sons; one of the firſt perſon only, another of the firſt and ſecond: and alſo two Fathers; one of the ffrſt perſon, who will be a Father by a double name; to wit, becauſe he hath begotten the ſecond and third perſon of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; another the ſecond perſon, who together with the Father, hath begotten the holy Spirit. But we have learned both from the holy Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iptures, and the Adverſaries, that there is but only One Father, and only one Son; to wit, by excellency ſo called.</p>
               <p>The more acute of the Adverſaries have ſeen this Rock of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and have endeavoured to avoid it. Therefore they have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that that definition of a Generation, which otherwiſe they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have delivered, is to be limited, and have ſaid, that not every communication of a ſubſtance with anohter, is a Generation, but at length that, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at which ſuch a relation follows, as is between Father and Son which is barbarouſly called <hi>Paternity</hi> and <hi>Filiation.</hi> In which indeed they are rediculous. As if forſooth it could be, that a perſon may communicate his ſubſtance really to a perſon, and yet ſuch a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may not thence preſently follow; and that perſon, which commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates his ſubſtance to another, by that very thing were not forthwith a Father, or (where there is a diſtinction of ſex, which is not in God) a Mother: and again, he to whom the ſubſtance is communicated a Son, or (where there is a diſtinct ſex) a Daughter. The Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries themſelves confeſs, that the words, <hi>Father, Son, Generation, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,</hi> as alſo other-like words, are by an Analogy ſaid of God and creatures, and that by reaſon of likeneſs they are tranſlated from theſe to God. But in things created, as ſoon as the ſubſtance is produced, the things is properly ſaid to be generated; nor is there any thing more required to the propriety of the word, but if a perſon have produced a perſon, preſently the one is called a Father, or, as we have ſaid, a Mother; the other a Son or Daughter. Therefore that which in God is <hi>analogum</hi> to that Generation, doth alſo deſerve to be termed Generation. But that is a production of another perſon, or a communication of the ſubſtance with another perſon. And the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence hereof is <hi>Paternity</hi> and <hi>Filiation, Analogum</hi> to
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:64944:158"/> that which we ſee in humane generations. For that generation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant among Perſons.</p>
               <p>But ſay ſome, therefore the production of a perſon is called a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, becauſe by it a perſon is produced not only like to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer in eſſence, but alſo in ſome other peculiar reſpect. For that ſecond perſon, as ſuch, is the image of the firſt, as that which is hath produced by underſtanding it ſelf; but that the Image is like to that the image of which it is. They ſay there is another reaſon of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the holy Spirit, for he is produced from the Father and Son by willing. But it is not the property of the will to produce ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like to that thing which it wills and deſires. Therefore that the holy Spirit, however by his Proceſſion he is become like to the Father and Son in Eſſence, or rather the ſame, yet in reſpect of his perſon, by which he is diſtinguiſhed from the Father and the Son, he is like to neither. But that Proceſſion at laſt is rightly termed a Generation, by which the perſon produced becomes altogether like the producer, but that proceſſion is rightly diſtinguiſhed from a generation, of which in that reſpect there is a different reaſon. But theſe ſubtil devices avail them nothing. For beſides that, we have refuted already<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.</note> above that device of the production of perſons, which may be by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or willing. There are yet two things which ſhew the vanity of this exception. The former is that to the propriety of a generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from another, it is not at all required, that the thing generated be like the thing generating in all things: but it is enough if it be like to it in eſſence or ſubſtance; from which likeneſs follows alſo a likeneſs of natural properties, and common to the whole genus or ſpecies, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the property of generation by it ſelf, is not ſeen in this, but in that; and if it could be, that the ſubſtance of the thing generated, were like to the ſubſtance of the thing generating, but the properties of both divers, nevertheleſs the property of generation would be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, although perhaps it might not be ſo eaſiely acknowledged becauſe we for the moſt part know things themſelves by the proper tokens, and conſequents of things. Wherefore if the holy Spirit by vertue of his proceſſion, became like in ſubſtance to the Father and Son, yea, the ſame, (for according to the Adverſaries <hi>identity,</hi> takes not away proceſſion nor generation in divine perſons) the holy Spirit was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated of the Father and Son, and ſo that his proceſſion is generation. In how many things, if you except the Eſſence and properties imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately following it, are ſons wont to be unlike the Fathers? yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, they are not therefore leſs properly ſaid to be generated of them, or to be their Sons. But here the eſſence and natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties are altoge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her the ſame. What then is there wanting in the holy Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it, to the propriety of generation? That I may omit, that the holy Spirit cannot be unlike the Father and Son, no not indeed in that propriety or character which they call <hi>hypoſtatical,</hi> if another, opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ſame Adverſaries concerning thoſe perſonal properties, be true. For they hold them to be the ſame really with the Eſſence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the three perſons, and only diſtinguiſhed from it by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:64944:159"/> Whence it neceſſarily follows, that he that hath that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in himſelf (as each of thoſe three perſons hath) hath alſo all thoſe properties in him, and that thoſe properties are no leſs common to the three perſons, than the Eſſence. Although that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion overthrows it ſelf. For they will be at once common and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in reſpect of the ſame perſons; and will make thoſe perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and not unlike, diverſe, and not diverſe.</p>
               <p>The latter, Why that reaſon or exception of the Adverſaries cannot have place, is; Becauſe if we follow their opinion concerning the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine attributes, nothing can proceed from the will, but together it proceeds from the underſtanding; and on the contrary. For with them all the divine attributes, and ſo the underſtanding and will, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>der the thing it ſelf, are altogether the ſame thing. For they are the very Eſſence of God, to which indeed doth agree, no not the leaſt compoſition or true diverſity. And indeed many Schoolmen ſay, that they may expreſs their opinion, That the underſtanding and will in God, as alſo his other attributes, are not only really, but alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally the ſame thing; that is, that they are not only ſo joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as that they can never be ſevered from one another, but alſo are not ſo much as indeed by proper forms or eſſences, and definitions diſtinguiſhed from each other. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would ſay, they are the ſame in reallity and reaſon. For with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> thoſe things are the ſame in reaſon, which have the ſame form, and the ſame definition; he ſaith they differ in reaſon who have diverſe. Now if in this manner, the will and underſtanding are the ſame thing in God, and ſo the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as the will it ſelf; and reciprocally, whatſoever procedes or is generated from the underſtanding, procedes alſo, and is generated from the will, and on the contrary. Therefore the production by the underſtanding, is no more generation, than that which is ſaid to proceed from the will; nor doth that produce a perſon like to the producer, more than this; neither is the Son more a Son than the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit; neither is the ſame Son leſs the holy Spirit, than the third perſon of the Trinity. For the Son hath no leſs proceeded from the will, than the holy Spirit; nor the holy Spirit leſs from the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, than the Son. Theſe indeed are the fruits of the ſubtilties, wherewith the Scholaſtick-Divinity ſwarmes. And yet we ſee, that thoſe who acknowledge the holy Scriptures for the only Rule of Faith, do follow and admire them.</p>
               <p>But they will ſay, the ſame Schoolmen have prevented theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For the divine attributes by their doctrine, although they be not actually diſtinguiſhed by the nature of the thing, or without the conſideration of our mind in any manner, neither really, nor formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet are they diſtinguiſhed <hi>eminenter;</hi> that is, <hi>vertually</hi> and <hi>potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</hi> And this difference is the foundation of the diverſity between the proceſſions of two perſons, of which we now treat, and likewiſe between various effects flowing from God; and laſtly, between the conceits and cogitations of our mind concerning the divine attributes. For we do inadequately conceive the divine attributes by reaſon of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:64944:159"/> the imperfection of our underſtanding, and therefore conſider them as diverſe, which in reality are altogether the ſame thing. And this the Schoolmen call diſtinction of reaſon, which they very often uſe. For when they have confounded together things diverſe, yet becauſe the diverſity of things offer it ſelf of its own accord to the minds of them that contemplate them, and they themſelves are compelled to ſpeak and diſpute of them as diverſe, they fly to this irrational diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of reaſon, as to a ſacred Anchor. But although we might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch this errour, lying hid even in obſcurity of words, as in its lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hole; yet I am willing firſt to draw it out thence, that the thing may be more clearly ſeen by them, who were never converſant in the Schools. To be diſtinguiſhed <hi>eminenter,</hi> and to be diſtinguiſhed <hi>actu,</hi> are by the Schoolmen oppoſed one to another; for it is known that <hi>potentia</hi> and <hi>virtus,</hi> are oppoſed to <hi>actus</hi> with the Philoſophers; and when the Schoolmen ſay that ſomething is diſtinguiſhed <hi>eminenter,</hi> it is all one with them as if they ſaid it is diſtinguiſhed vertually and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially. Thoſe things then are diſtinguiſhed <hi>eminenter,</hi> which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they are the ſame altogether actually, yet may be diſtinguiſhed, becauſe they have in ſome manner the force of more things, on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe diverſe operations and effects may flow from them; or becauſe being compared with things diverſe in ſome manner, they anſwer to the forms of each, or have divers reſpects to the ſame. But what ever they imagine, either there is an actual difference in the thing of which it is treated, or there is no diſtinction. For thoſe things are actually diſtinct of one of which ſomething is rightly affirmed, which of the other at the ſame time is rightly denyed. For if thoſe things never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, be altogether the ſame thing actually, contradictories will be together in the ſame thing, or the ſame thing will be together both af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed &amp; denyed of the ſame thing, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is impoſſible. But if you would be ſo obſtinate againſt the moſt dear Truth, as to ſay, nothing hinders but that contradictories may agree, to the ſame thing, if ſo be that it may vertually, or potentially be more things, nothing will hinder but that all things which are any where extant, are one thing actually, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſs vertually, or potentially: and if any will aſſert it, he can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by no reaſon. For if contradictions do not evince thoſe things, of which they are ſpoken to be diverſe actually, nothing will be able to evince it. For whatſoever differenceth one thing from another, differenceth it by the force of a contradiction: and every oppoſition, every difference doth tacitly include it in it ſelf, and unleſs it did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it, there would be nothing to hinder, but that oppoſites ſhould agree to the ſame thing. Rightly hath the Philoſopher ſaid, and ſaid it indeed according to the common conſent of all men, if two things are ſaid to be the ſame, whatſoever is ſaid of the one of them, is ſaid alſo of the other. If thou any thing truly may be ſaid of one thing; which is to be denyed of the other, thoſe things cannot ſimply be the ſame actually; but it is neceſſary that they be diſtinguiſhed in the thing, or in reaſon; that is, in form and proper eſſence. That thing verily doth neceſſarily happen in the underſtanding and divine will, if
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:64944:160"/> thoſe things be true, which we diſcourſed before according to the mind of tne antient Fathers and Schoolmen, concerning the diverſity between the Generation of the Son, and Proceſſion of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. For the Generation is ſaid to have been performed by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the underſtanding; the Proceſſion of the holy Spirit not ſo; this again by the operation of the will, that not ſo; it is ſaid to agree to the underſtanding, to produce ſomething altogether like to the thing underſtood, which is denyed of the will: the Father alone is ſaid to have produced the Son by the underſtanding; the Father not alone, but together with the Son, is ſaid to have produced the holy Spirit by the will. But if theſe things be true, and did exiſt actually before all conſideration of our mind, it is neceſſary that the divine Underſtanding and Will, were alſo actually diſtinct without all opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our mind. Wherefore let them either ceaſe to deny, that there is indeed any actual difference between the divine attributes, or let them take away the difference between the generation of the Son, and of the holy Spirit, and ſay that the Son is the holy Spirit, the holy Spirit again the Son; by which very thing they will overthrow the Doctrine of the Trinity. For ſo, beſides the Father, there will be only one perſon, the difference between the Son and holy Spirit being taken away.</p>
               <p>Before we put an end to this diſputation, ſince we are fallen into this diſcourſe concerning the vertual diſtinction, as they ſpeak, I am willing to add this fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ther, that the deviſe of the ſame Schoolmen is very vain, when they ſay, that the perſons of the Trinity are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the Eſſence neither really nor formally, but <hi>eminenter</hi> only; and further, by the intellect, which may even there conceive a diſtinction, where there is actually none. For if, as they hold, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence be actually communicable to more perſons, and was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable before all operation of our underſtanding; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, a perſon is incommunicable to more perſons; alſo there muſt actually be a difference between the eſſence and perſon; otherwiſe if altogether they are actually the ſame thing, contradictories may to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether be actually in the ſame thing, as is ſaid before. Neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in that alone, which we have now expreſſed, a contradiction will be implyed, but in all thoſe things, in which the perſon is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the Eſſence: as for example, <hi>That</hi> is a ſuppoſitum or perſon, <hi>this</hi> is not; <hi>that</hi> is really diſtinguiſhed from the other perſons, <hi>this</hi> is not diſtinguiſhed; <hi>that</hi> hath properly begotten, or was begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or proceeded from the Father and the Son, <hi>this</hi> not ſo. But what need we more words? altogether irrational, as we have ſaid, is that diſtinction of reaſon, which is there fained, where indeed there is none. Truly they who apply this diſtinction of reaſon to things, are much like to them, who, when they ſee but one man, they ſeem to themſelves they ſee two. Theſe are deceived in their eyes, thoſe in their minds. For the opinion of our mind cannot be true, if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the thing otherwiſe than it is: For Truth is adequation, as they ſpeak, or agreement of our underſtanding, and further alſo, of our
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:64944:160"/> words with the thing it ſelf. But if men do truly conceive that as diſtinct, which is not in very deed diſtinct, the conceits of the ſame thing contrary to one another, will be true, to wit, of God and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral men. For God, and the bleſſed Angels, and Men, who ſee God as he is, conceive in their mind no difference in God (if the opinion of theſe men concerning the divine attributes, be true) becauſe there is none in him: mortal men do. But <hi>true</hi> cannot be contrary to <hi>true,</hi> no more, yea, leſs, than an Egg to an Egg, Milk to Milk. Neither may they fetcht patronage of ſo abſurd a diſtinction from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who ſaith, as we have before minded, that ſome things are really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct; ſome in reaſon. For with him thoſe things are diſtinct in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which the ſchoolmen ſay, are formally diſtinguiſhed; that is, which although they be united together, and by a certain indiſſolvable knot, either on both ſides, or on one part joyned, yet differ in forms and proper Eſſences; as docility, and the faculty of admiring in the ſame man: generation and corruption. For every natural, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called Generation, is the corruption of another thing, and on the contrary. Nevertheleſs, theſe things differ, yea, are oppoſite, and ſo have oppoſite eſſences alſo, which are in the ſame matter in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of divers things. For one thing is corrupted, another thing is generated. So the foundations alſo are diſtinguiſhed from the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which reſt on them. But thoſe things differ alſo in the whole ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus or predicament. So alſo the compariſons of the ſame thing, with divers relations, have forms and eſſences divers either in the genus or ſpecies, or number: as alſo <hi>termini</hi> and <hi>correlata</hi> differ. Therefore the intellect doth not feign thoſe diſtinctions in things, but in very deed finds them in them: and the Schoolmen themſelves ſay that thoſe things are diſtinct actually, which although we think not of them, are diſtinct in forms, although they exiſt together. But if they would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſuch a difference between the divine perſons and eſſence, the Patrons of it will neither be able to reconcile the common Doctrine of the Trinity with it ſelf, nor with their other Doctrines. Not with it ſelf, for by this means, each perſon will have its proper form and eſſence; and ſo thoſe perſons will be, and will not be at once of one eſſence. Not with their other doctrines, becauſe the exacteſt ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God will fall. But if they acknowledge not that diſtinction, then the Trinity will fall, all true difference between the eſſence and the perſons, and thereupon of the perſons alſo between themſelves being taken away. Wherefore which way ſoever the Adverſaries turn themſelves, they will not be able to defend that their Trinity, or plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of perſons in one Eſſence of God; and therefore there remains no other thing, than that they confeſs together with us, that there is no leſs one perſon, than one ſubſtance of God.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>In which the Uſe of this Diſputation concerning <hi>One God the Father,</hi> is explained.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THerefore having demonſtrated, that the moſt high God, is no leſs one in perſon than in eſſence, and that he is no other than the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it remains that we ſhew the Uſe of this Doctrine. Now this is ſo much the greater, by how much the contrary Doctrine is more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and ſo much the farther it ſpreads it ſelf, by how much the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the incommodities of the contrary opinion are extended. For, firſt, how neceſſary it is to underſtand and believe, that there is only One moſt high God, both the holy Scriptures ſhew, which do often inculcate it, and all men eaſily underſtand. But now unleſs you hold that there is only One Perſon of the Supream Deity, you can neither ſufficiently underſtand, nor conſtantly believe and maintain the Unity of the ſupream Deity. For as much as it is ſufficiently ſhewed by us, that more perſons having ſupream Divinity, are more moſt high Gods, But although this errour be ſomewhat infringed and diminiſhed by another errour, whilſt it is affirmed, that there is one eſſence in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe perſons, yet it is not altogether taken away, and ſuffers not men to underſtand ſufficiently, and to believe conſtantly that which is ſaid of the Unity of the divine Eſſence. For although you endeavour never ſo much, you cannot conceive in your mind, one and the ſame eſſence of three perſons really diſtinct from among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; eſpecially if you will think of thoſe things that, which either the holy Scriptures, or the Adverſaries themſelves aſſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and holy Spirit, belonging to the differencing of them from each other. For whoſoever hears even thoſe very names, and thinks the Son to be truly begotten of the Father, the holy Spirit to have proceeded from both, forthwith he muſt needs think three eſſences divers in number, however otherwiſe moſt like one another, or in
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:64944:161"/> ſome certain manner coupled together. Likewiſe he who thinks, that the Father ſent the Son, and again both together the holy Spirit, that the Son deſcended from Heaven, and, as they hold, aſſumed fleſh, neither of the other deſcended or aſſumed fleſh; again, that the holy Spirit deſcended in a bodily ſhape, the Father and the Son not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending; how is he not together conſtrained to cocceive in his mind diſtinct eſſences? And if he ſhall attribute ſupream Deity to each of them, he will conceive three Gods in number, although moſt like one another, and in a certain manner united together. Seeing therefore by this means, a multitude of Gods is brought in by that opinion, it is neceſſary that that by the ſame means alſo fall into thoſe abſurdities which follow from the multitude of Gods. He that holds more moſt high Gods, diſtributes the glory and honour due to one, unto more, and as much as he attributes to the reſt, ſo much he takes away from that one. For ſince they are held to be equal one to another, nor is one acknowledged to be ſubordinate to the other (although alſo a falſe opinion of ſubordination is as none) that which is attributed to one, doth not come to another. Wherefore he, who acknowledgeth and worſhippeth more perſons, having ſupream Divinity, transfers to more that which was due to one, and detracts from that one that which he attributes to the reſt. And, that you may more nearly behold the matter, if the Father alone, as we have demonſtrated, be the moſt high God; who doth not ſee that thoſe abſurdities do follow from the contrary opinion concerning the Trinity. For, firſt, the honour of the Father is diminiſhed, whilſt that, which by far he hath of all things moſt ſacred, and wherein he excels all things, is equally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with others; to wit, the ſupream Deity; and further, whatſoever things are proper to this alone, whether they be his works, or ours reſpecting his Glory and Honour. For preſently it is neceſſary, that both the creation of Heaven and Earth, and, that I may let paſs other innumerable works, the raiſing up, and exaltation of Chriſt, which we have ſhewed<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 18, 29.</note> by moſt clear teſtimonies of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be imputed to the Father alone, be thought common to the whole Trinity, as indeed the Adverſarias think. So neither doth the love of men, which ought to come ultimately to the Father alone, and to reſt in him only, come ultimately to him alone, but is diſperſed among more perſons, who are held to be altogether equal to him: likewiſe both honour, and truſt; and invocation, and all ſorts of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, are ultimately divided unto more, which wholly ought to come at length to one perſon.</p>
               <p>And theſe abſurdities indeed ariſe as well from the opinion of the ſupream deity of the Son, as from the doctrine concerning the ſupream deity of the holy Spirit. But that is more proper to the opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the holy Spirit, that divine empire and government is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to it, which doth not at all agree to it; and moreover, it is held to be God; to be adored of it ſelf, invocated, and celebrated, as the giver of all good things whatſoever; whereas none of theſe, as we have ſeen,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1, 3</note> are attributed to it in the holy Scriptures, nor can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:64944:162"/> ſince it is not a perſon. Therefore although otherwiſe the holy Spirit be ſubordinate to the moſt high God, as the middle cauſe of moſt divine actions; yet is it not ſo ſubordinate, as a perſon is wont to be, to whom an empire and manageing of affaires, and the parts of honour and worſhip, which are wont and ought to follow it, are gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by another, in which manner we ſee Chriſt, who is expreſly both called God, and being placed in the Throne of God, is ſaid to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all things, to be ſubordinate to God. Whence alſo it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that he be adored by all, and that all men put their truſt in him, and ſo be bold to implore his aid; neither is there any part of the divine Honour, which is not found to be attributed to him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſo, that it tend ultimately to the Father. None of theſe things are found concerning the holy Spirit. Wherefore the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do not only ſin in that, that they make the holy Spirit the moſt high God, but alſo ſimply in that, that they hold it to be a God, or endued with a divine Empire, and governing humane affaires; and further, that they ſay, that it is no leſs to be invocated and adored, than Chriſt, and that other things alſo are to be attributed to it, which properly are due to a divine and heavenly King, and Lord; being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of the moſt plain words of the Apoſtle, aſſerting 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6. <hi>That to us there is but one God the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him: and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But although this abſurdity, which we have explained in the latter place, doth more appear in the common opinion concerning the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, than concerning the Son of God; yet it doth appear alſo in this; and unleſs another errour; to wit, of the incarnation of the Son of God, had ſomewhat corrected that other, it would be yet more grievous. For whilſt before and beſides Jeſus Chriſt born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, I ſay; that man, whom they call the humane nature only, there is feigned an only begotten Son of God, who exiſted from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who was alwayes endowed together with the Father with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Empire over all things; a Deity is attributed to that thing, which not only was not ſubordinate to the moſt high God, or inveſted with ſo high an Empire by him, but indeed was never exiſtent. And in this latter part, this errour of it ſelf is more grievous, than that which is committed about the Deity of the holy Spirit. For the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit not only exiſted, and doth yet exiſt, but is alſo, as we have ſaid, a moſt divine thing, and truly united with, and ſubordinate to the moſt high God in moſt excellent works.</p>
               <p>We hear ſometimes ſome ſaying, that even therefore their opinion touching Chriſt, is to be preferred before our, becauſe it is conjoyned with his greater Glory. But the very love towards Chriſt our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, requireth, that we rather add ſome honour to him, than detract from him. Which men indeed firſt ſo deal, as if the matter did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on our arbitrement, and were not altogether to be eſtimated by the determination of the holy Scriptures; that is, of God himſelf, and the manifeſt reaſon of the thing it ſelf. Seeing therefore the holy

                  </gap>ning the ſupream divinity of Chriſt, doth, as we have ſeen, diminiſh it. Therefore although it ſhould at length be lawful out of our affection, to add ſomething to the honour of Chriſt, yet that would not be lawful, which is conjoyned with the Fathers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. It is not lawful to detract any thing from the honour of Chriſt: But neither is it lawful to take away any thing from the honour of the Father.

How then doth not that opinion of the adverſaries leſſen or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take away his true glory? To which is added, that the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion caſts down the man Chriſt out of the Kingly Throne, in which he was placed by God, and permits us not to acknowledge ſincerely that he is made by God, Lord and Chriſt. For theſe things happen not but to a perſon leſs than the moſt high God; ſuch as with them neither is the man Chriſt, or, as they call it, the humane nature, nor his divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Not <hi>this,</hi> becauſe it is the moſt high God, and therefore no whit leſs than he; not <hi>that,</hi> becauſe with them it is not a perſon, nor can be, if it ſubſiſt in another perſon. And to what purpoſe is that power of the humane nature, if it cannot exerciſe it by it ſelf? For nothing can act by it ſelf, if it be not a Suppoſitum; but God himſelf only acts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it. To what purpoſe is a double empire in the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which can be exerciſed but once by him?

               <p>Which that it may be the better underſtood, we ſhall recite yet more diſcommodities of that opinion which makes Chriſt the moſt high God, that it may be underſtood, that we have not raſhly, but for moſt weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cauſes departed from that opinion, which hath been received in ſo many ages. For that opinion in a great part takes away that end for which God would have the whole affair of our ſalvation to be man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by a man; and further alſo it, ſuffers us not to underſtand why God would ſo do. For God looked on two things in that matter, to wit, the eternal glory of his Name, for which he does all things, and the incomparable fruit of mankind. They take <hi>that</hi> away from God
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:64944:164"/> who make Chriſt ſuch a one, as that he could receive nothing from his Father, and could do all things by his own ſtrength without ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers aid, which thing they do, who make him the moſt high God. For in that ſo great a glory of God which he looked after, is chiefly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that he hath performed ſo hard things by a man, in whom other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there is not ſo great an abil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But the ſame men take away from us the fruit of ſo great a thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they withdraw from us the props and helps of our hope and truſt, by which through ſo hard a journey, we endeavour towards heaven. For firſt, they enervate the example both of ſo laborious piety, and felicity propounded to us by him, which we ought to take from Chriſt. For God would, that in Chriſt we ſhould ſee not only what we ought either to perform or to attain to; but alſo what we might. God himſelf might be to us an example both of holineſs, and felicity, to which we ought to aſpire, as indeed he is propounded to be looked on by us in both. For we are commanded<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15, 16.</note> to be holy as God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.<note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7.</note> To walk in the light, as he is in the light.

But men wanted a nearer example, and more fitted to their weakneſs. For by the example of God himſelf they might indeed learn what that is which they ought to do, or hope for (although neither that indeed exactly enough, ſince on both ſides much i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For as concer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer thing, even Chriſt was encompaſſed with fleſh like to our fleſh, that is as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks,<note n="‖" place="margin">

                  <hi>Fleſh of ſin,</hi> or <hi>ſinful,</hi> which alſo all the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which draw us to ſin, might of themſelves invite and provoke. It did no leſs abhor than ours from ſo bitter a death as was ſet before him: But that which it could not do of it ſelf, God effected by his help in it. For he brought Chriſt to the moſt exact holineſs, and free from all blemiſh; that thence might flow to us an example, by which we might be forbidden to doubt, that we being ſupported by divine aid might perform that piety which God requires of us, not indeed equal, but like to the holineſs of Chriſt. And hither among other things doth <hi>Paul</hi> look when he writes to the <hi>Romans,</hi> eſpecially if you view his words in Greek, <hi>What was impoſſible to the Law, in as much as it was weakned by fleſh, God having ſent his Son, in the likeneſs of the fleſh of ſin, and</hi> (or, <hi>and that) for ſin, condemned ſin in the fleſh, that the juſtification of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit.</hi> It was impoſſible for the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law to free us from the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and power of ſin, and conſequently alſo of the everlaſting death. It endeavoured indeed to perform it, but our fleſh ſo prone to ſin, withſtood its endeavour, and leſſened its force, ſo as it could not
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:64944:164"/> attain to that which it would. What therefore the Law could not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in us, that God afterwards effected by his Son Jeſus Chriſt. For he ſent him to us encompaſſed with fleſh like to ours, which is ſo prone to ſin, and obnoxious to the ſame evils, with which ſinners a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e wont to be preſſed; and that he might aboliſh ſin in us, firſt he took away and blotted out its force in the fleſh of Chriſt, that ſo the juſtification, which the Law promiſed indeed, but could not, as was ſaid, perform, by reaſon of our fleſh, might happen to us alſo, living after the example of Chriſt, not after the luſts of the fleſh, but after the guidance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. By which things it eaſily appears, that God would propound to us in Chriſt ſuch an example of piety, as by which we might learn, not only what we ought to do, but alſo what we may do bei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As to the latter thing, we are in like manner taught by the example of Chriſt, not only what that is, which we ought to obtain, but alſo that we may obtain it, although we can by no means by our own ſtrength. For even Chriſt alſo, who was heretofore mortal, &amp; wholly l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But now they weaken the example of both, that is, piety and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, and take away its greateſt force, whoſoever makes Chriſt the moſt high God. For as to the former, what marvel is it, that the moſt high God lived holily? Can we learn from him what we are able to do? Is there ſuch a proportion of ſtrength pertaining to the holineſs between us and him, as there ought to be between us and Chriſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his holineſs? But if you ſay that the humane nature of Chriſt nevertheleſs was like unto ours, which was endued with ſuch holineſs by divine aid, that from it we may take ſuch an example, you are much deceived. For if the humane nature was not a Suppoſitum, it alſo, ſpeaking properly, hath done nothing, but the divine perſon of God himſelf according to it. But it matters much, yea infinitely, if we look to the power of doing, whether the moſt high God act, or man. Beſides, nevertheleſs in that humane nature did an infinite power of the ſupream Deity perſonally dwell, and ſo reſtrained it from all ſin, that it was altogether impoſſible for it to ſin; What l ke to that is in us? I forbear to ſpeak of thoſe things which they often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate, concerning the unlikeneſs between us and Chriſt, in reſpect of the original ſin, and the ſame great corruption of our nature, which was not at all in Chriſt, but in us is thought to be ſo great, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left to our ſelves, can do nothing almoſt but ſin.</p>
               <p>But as to the latter, to wit, our felicity, and the way of attaining it, what marvel is it that the moſt high God (for they will have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he being made a man, could die) did riſe again from the dead, and after became immortal? Is there any even the leaſt ability remaining in us after death, by which we maybe able to looſe our ſelves from its bonds, and recal our ſelves into life? Shall we then learn by
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:64944:165"/> the example of Chriſt that we may do what he could?</p>
               <p>But the opinion of the Adverſaries concerning Chriſt, doth another way alſo overthrow the props of our hope and truſt, which God ſet to ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>engthen it. For God would not by himſelf, or immediately, as they ſpeak, govern the whole buſineſs of our ſalvation, and bring it to an end, but hath put it into the hands of Jeſus Chriſt, both conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us by nature, and having ſuffered all evils which happen to no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him, that ſo he might erect us to the fureſt hope, namely, that he would not deſpiſe our baſeneſs, but ſo much the more readily ſuccour us, being vexed and afflicted. That which the divine author of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> hath ſhewed in ſeveral places; and firſt indeed of all about the end of the ſecond Chapter; for he had ſaid, That Chriſt <hi>no where took hold of Angels, but took hold of the ſeed of Abraham;</hi> that is, No where is it ſaid in Scripture that Chriſt was deſtinated by God to lay hold on, and help (for that is here <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) Angels, or that, he was employed therein; but this was his buſineſs, that he may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the poſterity and ſons of <hi>Abraham</hi> by his care, that he may help and for ever keep them, to wit, thoſe, who were not only born of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> according to the fleſh, but thoſe alſo who imitate his faith. Therefore when he had ſaid thus; he adds, <hi>Whence he ought to be made in all things like to his brethren</hi> (to wit, the true ſons of <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with fleſh and blood, and ſubject to all kind of adverſities) <hi>that he might be made a merciful and a faithful high Pcieſt to God</hi> (or in thoſe things which pertain to God) <hi>that he might make reconciliation for,</hi> or expiate, <hi>the ſins of the people. For in that in which he himſelf ſuffered, and was tempted</hi> (or when he was tempted) <hi>he is able to help them alſo who are tempted.</hi> Which ſame thing in ſome ſort he repeateth about the end of Chapter 4. and more fully declares Chap. 5.<note n="*" place="margin">Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther verſ. <hi>2, 3.</hi> and <hi>7, 8.</hi> ch. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> Namely the divine Author teacheth, that Chriſt, becauſe he had experience of the ſame evils, is ſo much the more prone to help and ſuccour us, being put into the like affliction? But how may we ſincerely enjoy this conſolation, if Chriſt be the immortal God himſelf, and free from all, even ſhadows of affliction? For it doth no whit avail, that the humane nature hath ſuffered and was dead, if ſo be theſe things happen unto that which is not a Suppoſitum. For if that nature be not a ſuppoſitum, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently doth not any thing by it ſelf, but whatſoever it doth, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perſon, that is, the moſt high God himſelf doth according to it, what avails it, that it ſuffered and had an experience of our evils? For the divine perſon himſelf, who is to be accommodated in very deed to do whatſoever Chriſt doth, nevertheleſs did not feel thoſe evils, nor could be made more prone for that cauſe to help us. And although the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature be held to concur to that action, by which help is brought from Chriſt to us; yet it ſhall not concur as left to its own will, as that which neceſſarily obeys the will and impulſe of the divinity, without which it can neither act nor ceaſe from acting, Therefore it will be all one in this reſpect, as if God himſelf immediately ſhould govern the whole buſineſs of our ſalvation. Therefore as they are injurious to the glory of God, and the true honour of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo alſo they are
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:64944:165"/> very injurious to themſelves, who aſcribe unto Chriſt a ſupream divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.

For one abſurdity being granted, many follow, and a chain of errors is eaſily knit. For beſides, that it is neceſſary, that the Adverſaries per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert many places of the holy Scripture, repugnant to their opinion, or not conſonant to it, and waeſt them to another meaning; ſome other Doctrines very hurtful to the Salvation of men are built upon it, which muſt needs fall down, it being overthrown. You may here rightly place that moſt groſs errour of many, concerning the ubiquity, as they call it, or omnipreſence of the body of Chriſt, by which the very ſubſtance of the body of Chriſt, together with his divinity, is fained to be entirely preſent in every place, leaſt and greateſt; which error, whatever the patrons of it ſay, ſuffers not Chriſt any more to be moved from place to place, than the divine nature it ſelf; and by its force takes away what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are read in the holy Scriptures (as there are read innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable things) which ſhew him to be comprehended in a certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of places, and that he went from place to place; and among other things, the conception of him in the womb of the Virgin; unleſs any ſay, that the Virgin was farther extended, not only than her garment or houſe, but all heavens; likewiſe alſo his aſcent into heaven and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from it, ſo neceſſary, as they call them Articles of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Faith; which whilſt they defend, who alſo hold the ubiquity of the body of Chriſt, they contradict themſelves, and aſſert neither of them fully and conſtantly. This is a grievous error both of it ſelf, and if you mark it, becauſe it overthrows the foundations of all Chriſtian knowledge and faith. For it denies credit to be given to the ſenſes, and will not that any more credit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But I will ſay no more of this error, as being not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the Adverſaries. Although in the mean while alſo a greater part of them affirmes the like things concerning the preſence of the ſubſtance of the body and blood of Chriſt in the Euchariſt, againſt the credit of the ſenſes themſelves. And laſtly, none of them can ſatisfie thoroughly the patrons of that <hi>ubiquity,</hi> as long as they hold the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of Chriſt to be joyned by an inſeparable tie to the divine, which wholly may ſubſiſt in its eſſence in all places. For unleſs the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature be altogether in the ſame places, in which the divine is; the humane nature will at the ſame time be joyned and not joyned in place to the whole divinity.</p>
               <p>But there is another errour, both injurious to the greateſt goodneſs of God towards us, and alſo very hurtful to piety, and conſequently alſo to mens ſalvation, which leans on that doctrine, and is vulgarly common to all the Adverſaries. For if Chriſt be the moſt high God, who dejected himſelf from the heavens into the Virgins womb, who an infant cried in the cradle, who eat, drank, wept, and underwent as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things proper to humane frailty, ſo alſo a grievous death; there was to be ſought ſome end agreeing to ſo abſurd a thing, that is equally abſurd, which hath put the moſt high God willing to ſave us on this neceſſity. Now that is commonly held to be, that the infinite God partly might make a full compenſation for the diſobedience of infinite numbers of men by the infinite merit of his obedience, which they call active; partly alſo by the infinite price of his death, might moſt fully ſatisfie his Father angry with us for all our ſins, both paſt and preſent, and to come; and might fully diſcharge all our debts to him; yea, if thoſe things which they ſay be true, might alſo pay much more than we ſhould owe, ſince they ſay, that even one drop of the blood of Chriſt, as being infinite God, hath ſatisfied for all the ſins of the whole world. Such a ſatisfaction, ſeeing becauſe it could be made by no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet was neceſſary to appeaſe the wrath of God; therefore they ſay, that God ought to be incarnated. There are indeed ſome found who have rejected the former part of that ſatisfaction, which conſiſts in the active obedience of Chriſt, as they call it. For they ſaw, that if Chriſt by his obedience had fully recompenced our diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, there would remain no ſins for which he ſhould ſatisfie by his death, all being already abundantly recompenced and extinct by that obedience. But they are both few, and nevertheleſs vehemently
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:64944:166"/> urge the latter ſatisfaction, conſiſting in the paſſive obedience, or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Death.

But beſides that that opinion which we have before explained, is more common; it muſt needs be that that was a neceſſary and inevitable thing, which compelled t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For God hath neither pardoned our ſins to us, if all that which was due to him, was paid to him by another in our ſtead and name, nor did he beſtow his Son for us a price of our Redemption, if it was paid him by the death of his Son.

But by what right could God any more exact of us the duty of piety, if Chriſt hath abundantly performed and recompenſed all things, both by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law in our ſtead, and alſo (of which thing now there was no more need) more than ſufficiently diſcharging all the puniſhments of our ſins by his death? For him it is lawful to exact as yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the debtor himſelf, who is not yet fully ſatisfied by another, in the name and ſtead of the debtor. He who payes for the debtor, hath a right of receiving that which is his own from him, unleſs he hath promiſed that he will forgive it unto him: But Chriſt will not have that right, if he be the ſame God with the Father. For if the matter be ſo, Chriſt himſelf was to be ſatisfied no leſs than the Father; and when he ſatisfied him, he ſatisfied himſelf alſo; if ſo be that any can ſatisfie himſelf. If therefore that he paid of his own, not of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we remaine his debtors, we owe as much to him, as before to his Father. There is a transferring of debts, alike grievous to us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you make the Son more kind than the Father.

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:64944:167"/> piety to us, and if we refuſe to perform it, of puniſhing us. This beſides that it is an impiety to think, it alſo takes away the neceſſity of living piouſly; but if there be no neceſſity for us to live piouſly, piety is loſt. Who is there that without neceſſity would undertake a thing which is hardeſt of all?

But it is known too much (the more is the pity!) how dangerous and how contrary doctrines (which it would be too long here to rek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con up) to piety, are built upon this one thing, of which we have now ſpoken. Withdraw from them the foundation ill laid, even the opinion concerning the ſupream Deity of Chriſt, you will perceive them all by and by to fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>But that opinion of the Supream Deity of Chriſt doth not only hurt them that hold it, but alſo others; for it keeps back thoſe from the embracing of the Chriſtian Religion, who are as yet averſe from it, and further, ſuffers them not to enter into the way of Salvation. For whilſt that thoſe things are the heads, and the chief heads of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, which are commonly believed of Chriſtians, concerning the Triune God, the Incarnation of the moſt high God, and the reſt, which in ſome manner depend on thoſe; and yet in the mean time do perceive, partly from the light of their Reaſon, partly from the holy Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, the manifeſt falſity of them, they cannot but be averſe from Chriſtian Religion, as falſe, and not inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
